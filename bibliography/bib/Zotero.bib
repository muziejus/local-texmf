  abstract = {This article develops a concept of lyrical sociology, a sociology I oppose to narrative sociology, by which I mean standard quantitative inquiry with its "narratives" of variables as well as those parts of qualitative sociology that take a narrative and explanatory approach to social life. Lyrical sociology is characterized by an engaged, nonironic stance toward its object of analysis, by specific location of both its subject and its object in social space, and by a momentaneous conception of social time. Lyrical sociology typically uses strong figuration and personification, and aims to communicate its author's emotional stance toward his or her object of study, rather than to "explain" that object. The analysis considers many examples and draws on literary criticism, the philosophy of time, and the theory of emotion. It also addresses contemporary debates in ethnography.}

It identifies topics that are particularly fruitful and generate new scholarship, and suggests ways in which each of these realms of urban history raises questions of relevance to urban planning and urban policy.}

  abstract = {In this paper I stage an encounter between two concepts that have become popular placeholders for a broad concern with a politics of life: affect and biopower. Through engagement with Antonio Negri’s writings on the ‘real subsumption of life’ in contemporary capitalism and Michel Foucault’s lectures on neoliberalism, I show that understanding how forms of biopower work through affect requires attending to three relations: affective relations and capacities are object-targets for discipline, biopolitics, security and environmentality; affective life is the outside through which new ways of living may emerge; and specific collective affects (including ‘state-phobia’) are part of the conditions for the birth of forms of biopower. In what is simultaneously a departure from, and an affirmation of, recent work on affect, I argue that attending to the dynamics of affective life may become political as a counter to forms of biopower that work through processes of normalisation. The consequence is that understanding how biopower works on and through affect becomes a precondition for developing affirmative relations with affective life.},

Used variously as a concept, ethos and descriptor, assemblage thinking can be placed within the context of the recent ‘relational turn’ in human geography. In this context, we argue that assemblage thinking offers four things to contemporary social-spatial theory that, when taken together, provide an alternative response to the problematic of ‘relational’ thought: an experimental realism orientated to processes of composition; a theorization of a world of relations and that which exceeds a present set of relations; a rethinking of agency in distributed terms and causality in non-linear, immanent, terms; and an orientation to the expressive capacity of assembled orders as they are stabilized and change. In conclusion, we reflect on some further questions of politics and ethics that follow from our account of the difference assemblage thinking makes to relational thought.},

Divided into four chapters, the book addresses four recurrent themes: wealth and luxury; victimhood and victimization; resistance and rebellion; and resilience and achievement. Considering the roles of various social actors who have contributed to the introduction of slavery in the museum in the last thirty years, the analysis draws on selected exhibitions, and institutions entirely dedicated to slavery, as well as national, community, plantation, and house museums in the United States, England, France, and Brazil. Engaging with literature from a range of disciplines, including history, anthropology, sociology, art history, tourism and museum studies, Araujo provides an overview of a topic that has not yet been adequately discussed and analysed within the museum studies field. Museums and Atlantic Slavery encourages scholars, students, and museum professionals to critically engage with representations of slavery in museums. The book will help readers to recognize how depictions of human bondage in museums and exhibitions often fail to challenge racism and white supremacy inherited from the period of slavery},

It illuminates how and why over the last five decades the debates about slavery have become so relevant in the societies where slavery existed and which participated in the Atlantic slave trade. The book draws on a variety of case studies to investigate its central questions. How have social actors and groups in Europe, Africa and the Americas engaged with the slave past of their societies? Are there are any relations between the demands to rename streets of Liverpool in England and the protests to take down Confederate monuments in the United States? How have black and white social actors and scholars influenced the ways slavery is represented in George Washington's Mount Vernon and Thomas Jefferson's Monticello in the United States?How do slave cemeteries in Brazil and the United States and the walls of names of Whitney Plantation speak to other initiatives honoring enslaved people in England and South Africa? What shared problems and goals have led to the creation of the International Slavery Museum in Liverpool and the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC? Why have artists used their works to confront the debates about slavery and its legacies? The important debates addressed in this book resonate in the present day. Arguing that memory of slavery is racialized and gendered, the book shows that more than just attempts to come to terms with the past, debates about slavery are associated with the persistent racial inequalities, racism, and white supremacy which still shape societies where slavery existed. Slavery in the Age of Memory: Engaging the Past is thus a vital resource for students and scholars of the Atlantic world, the history of slavery and public history"--},

Before long, Walker finds himself caught in a perverse triangle that leads to a sudden, shocking act of violence that will alter the course of his life." "Three different narrators tell the story of Invisible, a novel that travels in time from 1967 to 2007 and moves from Morningside Heights, to the Left Bank of Paris, to a remote island in the Caribbean. It is a book of youthful rage, unbridled sexual hunger, and a relentless quest for justice. With uncompromising insight, Auster takes us into the shadowy borderland between truth and memory, between authorship and identity, to produce a work of unforgettable power that confirms his reputation as "one of America's most spectacularly inventive writers.""--BOOK JACKET},

  abstract = {Novelist, essayist, and public intellectual, James Baldwin was one of the most brilliant and provocative literary figures of the postwar era, and one of the greatest African-American writers of this century. A self-described "transatlantic commuter" who spent much of his life in France, Baldwin joined a cosmopolitan sophistication to a fierce engagement with social issues. Early Novels and Stories presents the novels and short stories that established Baldwin's reputation as a writer who fused unblinking realism and rare verbal eloquence. His first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain (1953), tells the story, rooted in Baldwin's own experience, of a preacher's son coming of age in 1930's Harlem. Giovanni's Room (1956) is a searching, and in its day controversial, treatment of the tragic self-delusions of a young American expatriate at war with his own homosexuality. Another Country (1962), a wide-ranging exploration of America's racial and sexual boundaries, depicts the suicide of a gifted jazz musician and its ripple effect on those who knew him. Going To Meet the Man (1965) collects Baldwin's short fiction, including the masterful "Sonny's Blues," the unforgettable portrait of a jazz musician struggling with drug addiction in which Baldwin came closest to defining his goal as a writer.},

  abstract = {While most literary scholars wish to help readers understand literary texts by providing them with explanatory annotations, we want to go a step further and enable them, on the basis of structured information, to arrive at interpretations of their own. We therefore seek to establish a concept of explanatory annotation that is reader-oriented and combines hermeneutics with the opportunities provided by digital methods. In a first step, we are going to present a few examples of existing annotations that apparently do not take into account readerly needs. To us, they represent seven types of common problems in explanatory annotation. We then introduce a possible model of best practice which is based on categories and structured along the lines of the following questions: What kind(s) of annotations do improve text comprehension?

As Clive Barnes wrote, “Time catches up with genius … Waiting for Godot is one of the masterpieces of the century.”The story revolves around two seemingly homeless men waiting for someone—or something—named Godot. Vladimir and Estragon wait near a tree, inhabiting a drama spun of their own consciousness. The result is a comical wordplay of poetry, dreamscapes, and nonsense, which has been interpreted as mankind’s inexhaustible search for meaning. Beckett’s language pioneered an expressionistic minimalism that captured the existential post-World War II Europe. His play remains one of the most magical and beautiful allegories of our time.},

  abstract = {Narrating a world of flux entails moving away from equilibrium-oriented thinking toward considerations of emergence, uncertain futures, and unintended consequences. This is not the exclusive domain of the qualitative theory construction and analysis that has dominated such thinking in sociospatial theory: it is also involved in mathematical theory construction. It requires a relational approach to mathematical theory, however, that moves beyond unidirectional claims of cause and effect, avoids deterministic and teleological thinking, and recognizes the incompleteness and openness of any such theoretical construction. These arguments are explored through an example that employs mathematical techniques often associated with complexity theory to examine unevenly shifting economic landscapes where the best guesses of capitalist entrepreneurs are interrelated with the emergent multiregional economy in which capitalists participate. This highlights the unexpectedly heightened dynamical importance of regions in a globally connected world; how cherished theoretical principles become renegotiated, as relationality leads to emergence; and that there is space for human agency, through modeling praxis appropriate to ‘incomplete systems’. We open modest cracks in the supposed wall between quantitative and qualitative approaches, oriented toward a methodological reinterpretation of what employing mathematical arguments could mean within larger, postpositivist theoretical projects in critical human geography.}

  abstract = {To talk about affective tendencies is almost always to talk about intensities, and behind that linkage is a relation to melodrama, that modality of performance that attaches feeling states to their gestural inflation in bodily performance. In contrast, Raymond Williams’ model of the structure of feeling places the historical present and the affective present in a space of affective residue that constitutes what is shared among strangers beneath the surface of manifested life. “Structures of Unfeeling: Mysterious Skin” reads with Scott Heim’s novel and Gregg Araki's film to think about how to think about the structural, historical, and affective overdeterminations of underperformed emotion, tracking the emergence of a cultural style that appears as reticent action, a spatialized suspension of relational clarity that signifies a subtracted response to the urgencies of the moment (the historical moment, the sexual moment, the intimate moment, the moment where survival time is being apprehended, absorbed, and encountered).},

For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.},

Following Althusser, it offers a model for reading “generously” that is specific to a world in which the dominant forms of literary and cultural engagement have emerged alongside the novel as a form. The article revisits Walter Benjamin's “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” as well as Alain Badiou's proposition of a “subtractive” reading, Paul Ricoeur's method of “recollection,” and Gilles Deleuze's notion of the “image of thought” to argue that under current historical conditions the most pressing injunction is not to read “against the grain” but to read with it and that, furthermore, in so doing we remain faithful to the spirit of Benjamin's injunction to “brush history against the grain.”},

Each is demarcated by a linear boundary, an edge dividing  one sovereignty from the next. The division is accentuated when each  territory is blocked out in a separate color from neighboring states,  implying that its interior is a homogeneous space, traversed evenly  by state sovereignty. Our world is a jigsaw of territorial states, and  we take this picture for granted. Thus our historical atlases show  medieval Christendom also divided into demarcated and homogeneous  territories, though perhaps less neatly (see, for example, McEvedy  1992). Only the configuration is different. Familiar to us, such a  depiction would have been utterly unknown to people at the time,  who rarely used maps to represent geographical information and  did not imagine states (or rather realms) as enclosed spaces. The  transformation of their world into ours—the way the state  was put on the map—is the subject of this essay.},

We locate forceful and influential philosophical interventions in the writings of Nietzsche and Heidegger and foundational revisions in the linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure and his structuralist inheritors. We also chart the parallel path of literary theory from Mallarme through Blanchot and poststructuralism to deconstruction. We conclude, after making some observations about the politicization of language in the works of feminist and postcolonial theorists, with some remarks about how the question of language helps to problematize global knowledge.},

Our perspective is that models are developed iteratively: We build a model, use it to analyze data, assess how it succeeds and fails, revise it, and repeat. We describe how new research has transformed these essential activities. First, we describe probabilistic graphical models, a language for formulating latent variable models. Second, we describe mean field variational inference, a generic algorithm for approximating conditional distributions. Third, we describe how to use our analyses to solve problems: exploring the data, forming predictions, and pointing us in the direction of improved models.},

This problem arises from neglect of the activities and insights of textual scholarship and is inherited from, rather than opposed to, the New Criticism and its core method of “close reading.” Literary history requires not new or integrated methods but a new scholarly object capable of managing the documentary record’s complexity, especially as manifested in emerging digital knowledge infrastructure. Building on significant, though uneven and unacknowledged, departures from Moretti’s and Jockers’s work in data-rich literary history, this essay describes such an object, modeled on the foundational technology of textual scholarship: the scholarly edition.},

She shows how Latinx expressive practices expose how every rescaling of economic and military power requires new modalities of capture, new ways to bracket and hedge life. Through readings of novels by Helena María Viramontes, Oscar Casares, Lorraine López, Maceo Montoya, Reyna Grande, Daniel Peña, and others, Brady illustrates how submerged captivities reveal the way mechanisms of constraint such as deportability underpin institutional forms of carceral modernity and how such practices scale relations by naturalizing the logic of scalar hierarchies underpinning racial capitalism. By showing how representations of the captive child critique the entrenched logic undergirding colonial power, Brady challenges racialized modes of citizenship while offering visions for living beyond borders"--},

The article argues that the great contribution of Haraway’s work is the re-grounding of the subject in material practice. This neo-foundationalist approach is combined, however, with a firm commitment to a process ontology that looks at subjectivity as a complex and open-ended set of relations. The article argues for the centrality of the notion of relationality in Haraway’s thought, and in this respect her work can be compared to Deleuze’s rhizomic thinking. Special emphasis is placed on the analysis of the relation to other species in comparison with Deleuze’s notion of becoming-animal.},

Before the Holocaust, Yiddishland was a vast expanse of Eastern Europe running from the Baltic Sea to the western edge of Russia and featured hundreds of Jewish communities, numbering some 11 million people. Within this territory, revolutionaries arose from the Jewish misery of Eastern and Central Europe; they were raised in the fear of God and respect for religious tradition, but were then caught up in the great current of revolutionary utopian thinking. Socialists, Communists, Bundists, Zionists, Trotskyists, manual workers and intellectuals, they embodied the multifarious activity and radicalism of a Jewish working class that glimpsed the Messiah in the folds of the red flag Today, the world from which they came has disappeared, dismantled and destroyed by the Nazi genocide. After this irremediable break, there remain only survivors, and the work of memory for red Yiddishland. This book traces the struggles of these militants, their singular trajectories, their oscillation between great hope and doubt, their lost illusions--a red and Jewish gaze on the history of the twentieth century"-- Provided by publisher},

Their respective devaluation of political liberty, equality, substantive citizenship, and the rule of law in favor of governance according to market criteria on the one side, and valorization of state power for putatively moral ends on the other, undermines both the culture and institutions of constitutional democracy. Above all, the two rationalities work symbiotically to produce a subject relatively indifferent to veracity and accountability in government and to political freedom and equality among the citizenry.},

Moving from an over-reliance on the 'madwoman' as a romanticized figure constructed in opposition to the status quo, contributors to this volume examine how black women authors use madness, trauma, mental illness, and psychopathology as a refraction of cultural contradictions, psychosocial fissures, and political tensions of the larger social systems in which their diverse literary works are set through a cultural studies approach. The volume is constructed in three sections: Revisiting the Archive, Reinscribing Its Texts: Slavery and Madness as Historical Contestation, The Contradictions of Witnessing in Conflict Zones: Trauma and Testimony, and Novel Form, Mythic Space: Syncretic Rituals as Healing Balm. The novels under review re-envision the initial trauma of slavery and imperialism, both acknowledging the impact of these events on diasporic populations and expanding the discourse beyond that framework. Through madness and healing as sites of psychic return, these novels become contemporary parables of cultural resistance" -- Provided by publisher},

In The Reaper's Garden, Vincent Brown asks this question about Jamaica, the staggeringly profitable hub of the British Empire in America - and a human catastrophe. Popularly known as the grave of the Europeans, it was just as deadly for Africans and their descendants. Yet among the survivors, the dead remained both a vital presence and a social force." "In this story of a world in flux, Brown show that death was as generative as it was destructive. From the eighteenth-century zenith of British colonial slavery to its demise in the 1830s, the Grim Reaper cultivated essential aspects of social life in Jamaica - belonging and status, dreams for the future, and commemorations of the past. Surveying a haunted landscape, Brown unfolds the letters of anxious colonists, listens in on wakes, eulogies, and solemn incantations, peers into crypts and coffins, and finds the very spirit of human struggle in slavery. Masters and enslaved, fortune seekers and spiritual healers, rebels and rulers, all summoned the dead to further their desires and ambitions. In this turbulent transatlantic world, Brown argues, "mortuary politics" played a consequential role in determining the course of history."--BOOK JACKET},

In the process, discussions of epistemological and ontological issues have become less prominent. The peace that has broken out has proved to be more favourable to research combining quantitative and qualitative research than was the case during the paradigm wars. Drawing on interviews with social researchers who employ a mixed‐methods approach and on the literature, it is shown that a spirit of pragmatism with regard to combining quantitative and qualitative research prevails which encourages researchers to consider using mixed‐methods research when the research question is suited to it. However, the issue of which quality criteria should be employed in investigations combining quantitative and qualitative research has not been given a great deal of consideration. The author argues for a contingency approach, in which issues to do with quality are decided in relation to the nature of the study.},

Such efforts produced many slave laws and policing efforts, which legitimized and expanded slaveholders’ dominance and power, but ironically, increased enslaved people’s bargaining powers. Exploring how legal definitions of poison and Obeah changed over time and the political and social purposes poison and Obeah accusations served, reveals the complex ways in which the enslaver and enslaved struggled for dominance and survival within Jamaica’s slave society. While poison and Obeah laws, accusations and prosecutions give us good insights into the complicated conflicts, tensions and negotiations between enslaver and enslaved and among members of slave communities, they yield an unfortunate legacy that defame Obeah as witchcraft and fraud and erroneously attribute poison as a key element.},

This denial, in turn, rests upon the supposition that Indigenous Australians were living in a ‘savage’, pre-civilized state: the state of nature of liberal theory. Such concepts, deeply embedded in western political thought, informed the view that Australia was a terra nullius or unowned land. Consequently, the contrast between ‘savagery’ and its counterpart, ‘civilization’ formed a critical element of colonial arguments that Australia could be colonized without either a war of ‘conquest’, or making a treaty. We argue here that more than 14 years after the rejection of terra nullius in Australian law, its legacy and the assumptions that underpinned it persist in the concepts more recent debates deploy as well as in the concept of terra nullius that some of these debates rehabilitate.},

Butler.When unattended environmental and economic crises lead to social chaos, not even gated communities are safe. In a night of fire and death, Lauren Olamina, an empath and the daughter of a minister, loses her family and home and ventures out into the unprotected American landscape. But what begins as a flight for survival soon leads to something much more: a startling vision of human destiny...and the birth of a new faith, as Lauren becomes a prophet carrying the hope of a new world and a revoltionary idea christened "Earthseed".Chilling and thought-provoking for adult and young adult readers alike, "...there isn't a page in this vivid and frightening story that fails to grip the reader" (San Jose Mercury News).},

Un des apports de l'anthropologie des sciences et des techniques (AST) est de montrer que cette opposition ne constitue qu'une des configurations construites par l'action et sa distribution. Pour restituer la diversité de ces configurations l'AST a élaboré quatre principes. Le premier affirme le caractère hétérogène du social. Le deuxième conduit à considérer que toute entité est une réalité assimilable au réseau des éléments hétérogènes. Le troisième affirme que les entités sont à géométrie variable et qu'elles réorientent l'action dans des directions imprévisibles. Le quatrième propose que tout arrangement social stabilisé est à la fois un point (un individu) et un réseau (un collectif). L'analyse sociologique, si elle veut surmonter l'opposition entre individualisme et holisme, doit donc se donner pour objet l'étude de ces différentes configurations hybrides. /// The social sciences have devised a series of strategies in order to overcome the division between individual and collective action. However, science, technology and society (STS) has shown that this distinction is only one possible configuration for action and its distribution. In order to investigate other possible configurations, STS proposes four principles: that the social is heterogeneous in character; that all entities are networks of heterogeneous elements; that these networks are both variable in geometry and in principle unpredictable; and that every stable social arrangement is simultaneously a point (an individual) and a network (a collective). If sociological analysis is to overcome the individualism/holism division it should attend to the range of hybrid configurations.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is the first comprehensive study of the Yiddish literary group ‘Yung-Vilne’ (1929–1941). It explores the intersection of language, lineage, and locus, and its influences on a new generation of Yiddish writing in one of Eastern Europe's most important Jewish cultural centers. I argue that the group embraced a populist modernism that allowed it to appeal to audiences in both high and mass culture, and tolerate members who ranged from the politically engaged to the aesthetically detached. Through my excavation of the group's work, and a discussion of its members' role in the broad cultural life of Vilna, I highlight the symbiotic relationship between artistic corpus and cultural context. The primary goal of the dissertation is to provide a framework for understanding the group's struggle to satisfy the expectations of local audiences for a humanistic, socially engaged literature against some members' gravitation towards more rarefied forms of artistic expression that could expand the borders of Yiddish art. Chapter one shows how Yung-Vilne was an organic outgrowth of its cultural community. Chapter two introduces Yung-Vilna's first star, Leyzer Volf. I explain that Volf's comical engagement with canonical texts from the European and Yiddish literary spheres, and his grotesque re-interpretations of Vilna's physical and cultural landscape were emblematic of larger generational anxieties of Yiddish cultural parochialism. Chapter three discusses the group's magazine, Yung-Vilne, as a way to introduce its choir of visual artists, poets, and prose writers. My discussion highlights the tension between the pull of radical politics and the desire to escape from reality through literature. Chapters four and five offer extended readings of the group's two most famous writers, Chaim Grade and Abraham Sutzkever. I show how Grade re-introduced the language of faith and religious struggle into Yiddish literature at the precise historical moment when Yiddish writing was most alienated from tradition. Chapter five suggests that Sutzkever was also striving to recover metaphysical wonder. I show how his modernist innovation transcended the limitations of Vilna's material realities. The dissertation underscores the extent to which artistic choices made by Yung-Vilne were connected to the national struggle for cultural self-definition.},

This paper argues that Henri Lefebvre's work can be included within this tradition of “open Marxism”. In demonstrating how Lefebvre's work on everyday life, the production of space and the state derives from his open approach, the paper flags a potential problem of antinomy in an emergent new state spatialities literature that draws upon Lefebvre to supplement its structuralist–regulationist (“closed”) Marxist foundations. A Lefebvre-inspired challenge is therefore established: that is, to develop a critique of space which does not substitute an open theory of the space of political economy with a closed theory of the political economy of the regulation of space.},

  abstract = {We analyse silence and tranquillity in historical and contemporary corpora to understand ways landscapes were—and are—perceived in the Lake District National Park in England. Through macro and microreading we develop a taxonomy of aural experiences, and explore how changes to categories of silence from our taxonomy—for instance, the overall decline in mentions of absolute silence—provide clues to changes in the landscape and soundscape of the Lake District. Modern authors often contrast silence with anthropogenic sounds, while historical authors adhere to a cultural construction where the Lake District is presented as a tranquil area by ignoring industrial sounds. Using sentiment analysis we show that silence and tranquil sounds in our corpora are, as a whole, more positively associated than random text from the corpora, with this difference being especially marked in contemporary descriptions. Focusing closely on individual texts allows us to illustrate how this increased positivity can be related to the emergence of silence and tranquillity as valuable components of landscape. Mapping our corpora confirmed the influence of Wordsworth’s writing on descriptions of silence; and revealed the co-location of pockets of tranquillity near to transport arteries in contemporary descriptions.},

We study a sequence of restrictions that limit grammars first to Turing machines, then to two types of system from which a phrase structure description of the generated language can be drawn, and finally to finite state Markov sources (finite automata). These restrictions are shown to be increasingly heavy in the sense that the languages that can be generated by grammars meeting a given restriction constitute a proper subset of those that can be generated by grammars meeting the preceding restriction. Various formulations of phrase structure description are considered, and the source of their excess generative power over finite state sources is investigated in greater detail.},

In foregrounding the ethics of fiction writing, the book resists any triumphalist reading of Morrison's achievement in order to allow the meditative, unsettled, and unsettling questions that arise throughout her long labor at the nexus of language and politics, where her fiction interrogates representation itself. Moving between close reading and critical theory, Toni Morrison: An Ethical Poetics reveals the ways in which Morrison's primary engagement with language has been a search for how and what language is made to communicate, and for how and what speaks in and from generation to generation. There is no easy escape from such legacy, no escape into a pure language free of the burdens of racialized agendas. Rather, there is the example of Morrison's commitment to writerly, which is to say readerly, wakefulness. At a time when sustained study devoted to single authors has become rare, this book will be an invaluable resource for readers, scholars, and teachers of Morrison's work."--Publisher's website},

The volume's diverse contributors--literary and film critics, philosophers, and cultural theorists--offer original considerations of the temporality of slavery and the challenges of representation in the context of protracted Western traditions of anti-blackness. The essays vary in their objects of study, methods, and conclusions, matriculating to complex dialogue rather than a common endorsement. They are united chiefly by their attention to a paradox at the heart of black studies today: that the history of racial slavery gains intellectual potency and ubiquity in a moment marked by unprecedented legal gains and the popularly professed rise of "post-racial" sensibilities. Consolidating numerous perspectives on the desires, investments, and identitarian logics through which the legacy of slavery persists in contemporary life, this collection will be of interest to critics concerned with the diffuse reverberations of the slave past, and more generally, to those interested in current discussions of anti-black violence, "disposable" populations, and new forms and capacities of black political subjectivity"--},

As autonomous, militant research, this mapping aims to foster cooperation among researchers and participants to practically intervene in real problems without attempting to marshal state or administrative power. Our experience shows that~autonomous cartography helps produce new, alternative practices, knowledges and subjects at our university and others. Even as we draw on critical cartography and other cases of counter-mapping, autonomous cartography constitutes a distinct form of counter-mapping through our combination of autonomous theory, militant research and mapping. In this paper, we explore constitutive influences on 3Cs and our own militant countermapping experiences. We begin with a review of the theoretical basis of autonomous cartography as a form of critical cartography and counter-mapping. Next, we introduce the key concepts and practices of autonomous politics and militant research through the examples of Colectivo Situaciones, Precarias a la Deriva and Hackitectura. In the second half of the paper, we review 3Cs’ founding conditions and two of our maps. Finally, we conclude by examining the methods and impacts of our mappings.},

  abstract = {In probability theory, the conditional expectation, conditional expected value, or conditional mean of a random variable is its expected value evaluated with respect to the conditional probability distribution. If the random variable can take on only a finite number of values, the "conditions" are that the variable can only take on a subset of those values. More formally, in the case when the random variable is defined over a discrete probability space, the "conditions" are a partition of this probability space. Depending on the context, the conditional expectation can be either a random variable or a function. The random variable is denoted                         E         (         X         ∣         Y         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle E(X\textbackslash mid Y)\}    analogously to conditional probability. The function form is either denoted                         E         (         X         ∣         Y         =         y         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle E(X\textbackslash mid Y=y)\}    or a separate function symbol such as                         f         (         y         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle f(y)\}    is introduced with the meaning                         E         (         X         ∣         Y         )         =         f         (         Y         )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle E(X\textbackslash mid Y)=f(Y)\}   .},

Performativity has received increasing attention from scholars, and cartography is no exception. Interest has shifted from the map as object to mapping as practice. Performativity is a cultural, social and political activity; maps as protest and commentary. The internet both facilitates and shapes popular political activism, but scholars have been slow to grasp amateur political mappings, although analysis of political deployments of mapping in state, territorial and imperial projects remains rich. Finally, some authors suggest that cartography be understood as existence (becoming) rather than essence (fixed ontology).},

These developments are key components of a ‘maps as social constructions’ approach, emphasizing the genealogy of power in mapping practices, and enabling multiple, contingent and exploratory perspectives of data. Furthermore, this approach is an opportunity for cartography to renew its relationship with a critical human geography.},

  abstract = {Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:SyntaxObjectsFunctionsInheritanceArraysRegular expressionsMethodsStyleBeautiful featuresThe real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.},

  abstract = {Boundary organizations are designed to stabilize the relationship between science and policy communities. The literature emphasizes that products (i.e., boundary objects) should be salient, legitimate, and credible to both communities. The related field of participatory geographic information systems (PGIS) focuses on creating useful products (i.e., maps and geographic information systems) in an explicitly political environment. PGIS focuses more directly on the ways in which people may engage with information and power dynamics between actors. We argue that the epistemological parallels between PGIS and boundary organization research create an opportunity to fuse approaches to the advantage of both fields. Combining approaches facilitates communication and provides opportunities to negotiate conflict between science and policy. We apply the frames to a public information project conducted in a water resource decision-making boundary organization in Phoenix, Arizona. Through participatory action research, we evaluate the extent to which relationships between saliency, legitimacy, and credibility across change through time and interact with one another. We find that the boundary organization framework provides a unique role for science in framing questions and evaluating the feasibility of environmental management solutions. However, it neither guides the process of generating boundary objects nor adequately conceptualizes heterogeneity within the policy community. PGIS highlights processes internal to the policy community driving low levels of political support for initial maps of public information programs. Credibility improved after participants discussed why they felt maps lacked legitimacy, and credibility. Discussion among policy makers at a meeting convened by scientists improved legitimacy and credibility. Despite policy involvement in the process of generating research questions, the saliency of the map remained low. Policy stakeholders viewed the map as a necessary precursor to more usable science in the future rather than a as boundary object per se. The framework developed and applied in this paper is relevant to research centers and projects that intend to link policy and science that have stronger formal ties of accountability to science through funding.},

This chapter focuses on the spatial weavings of decolonial geographies as they take form on stolen and occupied Indigenous lands and waters. It theorises decolonial geographies as a constellation in formation. The chapter traces this language from Nishnaabeg scholar, activist and artist Leanne Betasamosake Simpson's work on constellations of co-resistance, while the author's spatial framing stems from bringing Indigenous geographies into dialogue with the geneologies of Black geographies envisioned by Katherine McKittrick and Clyde Woods (2007). The chapter also situates decolonial geographies within embodied theories and praxes of liberation to elucidate the connective fabric of various decolonial struggles. It elaborates on constellations in formation, as embodied in the present, to envision radical spatial visions of the future.},

  abstract = {Counter-mapping is a combination of critical ideas and practices for social change that offers a productive and promising approach for grassroots data science initiatives. Current information technologies collect, store, and analyze data with new degrees of size, speed, heterogeneity, and detail. While much work utilizing data science technologies is dedicated to generating profit or to national security, some data science projects explicitly attempt to facilitate new social relations, though with inconsistent results and consequences. This paper reviews counter-mapping's particular combination of theory and practice as a potential point of reference for such initiatives. Counter-mapping takes the tools of institutional map-making at government agencies and corporations and applies them in situated, bottom-up ways. Moreover, counter-mapping's multiple theoretical approaches and polyglot practices offer a variety of inspirations and avenues for future work in identifying and realizing alternative, ideally better, possibilities. This paper defines counter-mapping; outlines its multiple theorizations; briefly describes three relevant case studies, The Detroit Geographical Expedition and Institute, Mapping Police Violence, and the Counter-Cartographies Collective; and concludes with a few hard-learned considerations from counter-mapping that are directly pertinent for data-oriented projects focused on change.},

In this book, you'll learn how many of the most fundamental data science tools and algorithms work by implementing them from scratch. If you have an aptitude for mathematics and some programming skills, author Joel Grus will help you get comfortable with the math and statistics at the core of data science, and with hacking skills you need to get started as a data scientist. Today's messy glut of data holds answers to questions no one's even thought to ask. This book provides you with the know-how to dig those answers out. Get a crash course in Python. Learn the basics of linear algebra, statistics, and probability--and understand how and when they're used in data science. Collect, explore, clean, munge, and manipulate data. Dive into the fundamentals of machine learning. Implement models such as k-nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, linear and logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, and clustering. Explore recommender systems, natural language processing, network analysis, MapReduce, and databases."--Provided by publisher},

It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.},

  abstract = {Dijkstra's algorithm ( DYKE-strəz) is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.  It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later. The algorithm exists in many variants. Dijkstra's original algorithm found the shortest path between two given nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree. For a given source node in the graph, the algorithm finds the shortest path between that node and every other.:{$\mkern1mu$}196–206{$\mkern1mu$} It can also be used for finding the shortest paths from a single node to a single destination node by stopping the algorithm once the shortest path to the destination node has been determined. For example, if the nodes of the graph represent cities and costs of edge paths represent driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a direct road (for simplicity, ignore red lights, stop signs, toll roads and other obstructions), then Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest route between one city and all other cities. A widely used application of shortest path algorithms is network routing protocols, most notably IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) and OSPF (Open Shortest Path First). It is also employed as a subroutine in other algorithms such as Johnson's. The Dijkstra algorithm uses labels that are positive integers or real numbers, which are totally ordered.  It can be generalized to use any labels that are partially ordered, provided the subsequent labels (a subsequent label is produced when traversing an edge) are monotonically non-decreasing.  This generalization is called the generic Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm uses a data structure for storing and querying partial solutions sorted by distance from the start. Dijkstra's original algorithm does not use a min-priority queue and runs in time                         Θ         (                    |                  V                                 |                                   2                             )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash Theta (|V|\textasciicircum\{2\})\}    (where                                    |                  V                    |                          \{\textbackslash displaystyle |V|\}     is the number of nodes). The idea of this algorithm is also given in Leyzorek et al. 1957. Fredman \& Tarjan 1984 propose using a Fibonacci heap min-priority queue to optimize the running time complexity to                         Θ         (                    |                  E                    |                  +                    |                  V                    |                  log         ⁡                    |                  V                    |                  )                 \{\textbackslash displaystyle \textbackslash Theta (|E|+|V|\textbackslash log |V|)\}    . This is asymptotically the fastest known single-source shortest-path algorithm for arbitrary directed graphs with unbounded non-negative weights. However, specialized cases (such as bounded/integer weights, directed acyclic graphs etc.) can indeed be improved further as detailed in Specialized variants. Additionally, if preprocessing is allowed algorithms such as contraction hierarchies can be up to seven orders of magnitude faster. In many fields, artificial intelligence in particular, Dijkstra's algorithm or a variant of it is known as uniform cost search and formulated as an instance of the more general idea of best-first search.},

What other organizing principles might come into play? And how would they affect the mapping of "literature" as an analytic object: the length and width of the field; its lines of filiation, lines of differentiation; the database needed in order to show significant continuity or significant transformation; and the bounds of knowledge delineated, the arguments emerging as a result? In this essay, I propose one candidate to begin this line of rethinking: the concept of literary genre. Genre, of course, is not a new concept; in fact, it is as old as the recorded history of humankind. Even though the word itself is of relatively recent vintage (derived from French, in turn derived from the Latin genus),1 the idea that there are different kinds of literature (or at least different kinds of poetry) came from ancient Greece. Traditionally it has been seen as a classifying principle, putting the many subsets of literature under the rule of normative sets. Theorists like Benedotto Croce have objected to it on just these grounds. "[I]nstead of asking before a work of art if it be expressive and what it expresses," genre criticism only wants to label it, putting it into a pigeonhole, asking only "if it obey the laws of epic or of tragedy." Nothing can be more misguided, Croce says, for these "laws of the kinds" have never in fact been observed by practicing writers (36–37).2 Derrida makes the same point. "As soon as genre announces itself, one [End Page 85] must respect a norm, one must not cross a line of demarcation, one must not risk impurity, anomaly, or monstrosity." This sort of border policing is madness, he says, for the law of genre is an impossible law; it contains within itself a "principle of contamination," so much so that the law is honored only in its breach (224–5).  Family Resemblance  Keeping these objections in mind, I invoke genre less as a law, a rigid taxonomic landscape, and more as a self-obsoleting system, a provisional set that will always be bent and pulled and stretched by its many subsets. Such bending and pulling and stretching are unavoidable, for what genre is dealing with is a volatile body of material, still developing, still in transit, and always on the verge of taking flight, in some unknown and unpredictable direction. "Genre is much less of a pigeonhole than a pigeon," Alasdair Fowler has suggested. Movement is key, and if this movement is vested in the concept of kinds, it is not as "permanent classes," but as "families subject to change (37,v)." This analogy to "families" is especially worth thinking about. It reminds us that genre is not just a theory of classification but, perhaps even more crucially, a theory of interconnection. Kin is every bit as important as kind. And, by kin, what I have in mind is not necessarily a genealogical relation, but, just as often, a remote spectrum of affinities, interesting when seen in conjunction, but not themselves organically linked. Likeness here is probabilistic and distributional; it has less to do with common ancestry than with an iterative structure of comparable attributes, issuing from environments roughly similar but widely dispersed. What matters here is not lineage, but a phenomenal field of contextually induced parallels. Born of the local circumstances that shape them, and echoing other genres shaped by circumstances more or less alike, they make up a decentralized web, something like what Deleuze and Guattari call a "rhizome." This web can be further elucidated by a concept from Wittgenstein: "family resemblance."3 Wittgenstein uses it to talk about a conceptual elasticity that classifies tennis, chess, and ring-a-ring-a-roses under the same heading—"games"—constituting this as a "family," with a largely undefined and infinitely expandable membership. Tennis, chess, and...}

In order to critique spatially and temporally coherent characterizations of neoliberalism, brief case analyses of fan reactions to the commercialization of Brazilian club Corinthians and English club Manchester United are used. Specifically, comparative insights from fans’ negotiation of market-based restructurings reveal how neoliberal ‘flows’ are implemented and experienced differently in different places. Particularities in these flows are employed to disassemble hegemonic and universal visions of neoliberalism through the notion of friction.},

  abstract = {"The first and only successful slave revolution in the Americas began in 1791 when thousands of brutally exploited slaves rose up against their masters on Saint-Domingue, the most profitable colony in the eighteenth-century Atlantic world. Within a few years, the slave insurgents forced the French administrators of the colony to emancipate them, a decision ratified by revolutionary Paris in 1794. This victory was a stunning challenge to the order of master-slave relations throughout the Americas, including the southern United States, reinforcing the most fervent hopes of slaves and the worst fears of masters." "But peace eluded Saint-Domingue as British and Spanish forces attacked the colony. A charismatic ex-slave named Toussaint Louverture came to France's aid, raising armies of others like himself and defeating the invaders. Ultimately Napoleon, fearing Toussaint's enormous political power, sent troops to crush him and subjugate the ex-slaves. After many battles, a decisive victory over the French secured the birth of Haiti and the permanent abolition of slavery from the land. The independence of Haiti reshaped the Atlantic world by leading to the French sale of Louisiana to the United States and the expansion of the Cuban sugar economy." "Laurent Dubois weaves the stories of slaves, free people of African descent, wealthy whites, and French administrators into an unforgettable tale of insurrection, war, heroism, and victory. He establishes the Haitian Revolution as a foundational moment in the history of democracy and human rights."--BOOK JACKET},

Eakin disagrees with Strawson's statements that deny narrativity as more than a literary form. He believes in the power of narrative as a tool for self-representation and self-understanding. In the end, he questions if narrative should remain a function of language or something more essential to people and society.},

(Brenner and Theodore, Antipode 34(3), pp. 349?379, 2002). In the second section, the World Cup is taken as an empirical example for how and in which forms neoliberalization FIFA?style shapes and is shaped by the urban form, that is, the commercialization and commodification of (public) space and its hierarchization. In the same line, the ?safety, order and security? complex (SOS) and its strategies and tactics demanded by FIFA are analyzed in terms of humanware, software and hardware. The paper concludes by showing that the nonprofit FIFA has been able to determine not only the glocal football market, but as well the urban form, the respective security networks, and the tax?free absorption of profits from state and private actors before, during and after World Cups.

  abstract = {In the mid-1990s, several critical texts raised concerns about the social, political, and epistemological implications of GIS. Subsequent responses to these critiques have fundamentally altered the technological, political, and intellectual practices of GIScience. Participatory GIS, for instance, has intervened in multiple ways to try to ameliorate uneven access to GIS and digital spatial data and diversify the forms of spatial knowledge and spatial logic that may be incorporated in a GIS. While directly addressing core elements of the ‘GIS \& Society’ critique, these reconstructions of a critical GIScience introduce their own ambiguities with respect to access, equity, digital representation of spatial knowledge, and epistemologies of new GIS research practices. In this paper, I examine some of the new and persistent ambiguities of participatory GIS that bear inclusion in future critical GIScience research.},

I demonstrate these theoretical horizons through an analysis of ?glitch politics? that refuse normative digital-social-spatial relations of technocapitalist urban life, and catalyze sociospatial relations of thriving otherwise, drawing examples from digital practices of street newspapers sold by unsheltered people in cities worldwide.},

  abstract = {Blogging, social networking, and other Web 2.0 practices have sparked widespread debate about the status and future of privacy. This paper examines an explicitly geographical aspect of Web 2.0 with respect to these debates: the geospatial web, or ‘geoweb’. As part of fundamental shifts in the kinds of geographic information available, its circulation, and representative forms it assumes, the geoweb implies new objects of privacy concern and subsequent privacy-related negotiations over the aggregate of its component information, technologies, and data praxes. Thus we argue that privacy must not only be revisited, but indeed re-conceptualized. Whereas prior research on privacy vis-à-vis geographic information technologies has tended to question what privacy ‘is’, we focus instead on the constitutive outcomes of societal struggles over privacy. We examine how privacy is being negotiated around two geoweb services – Google Street View and the Twitter GeoAPI – to illustrate that these contestations produce privacy as a social object in particular ways. We show that public discourse around actual or anticipated privacy harms stemming from geoweb services and their uses, as well as the preventatives and remedies proposed or implemented to address such harms, reconstitute the objects and practices of privacy concern, and alter the roles and relationships of state, civil and corporate actors in the construction of privacy. Finally we suggest that the geoweb raises new privacy concerns because some of its representational forms – namely geo-tagged images and self-authored texts – facilitate identification and disclosure with more immediacy and less abstraction.},

By contrast, this "manifesto" presents an alternative, "relational" perspective, first in broad, philosophical outlines, then by exploring its implications for both theory and empirical research.

Barnes let melancholia loose upon her novel's narrative, where it hampers teleological momentum and reveals the problems of novelistic telling: the domination of the narrator, the submission of suffering characters, the compulsions of narrative desire. While Peter Brooks (1984) argues for the persistence of plot and narrative desire in fiction, Barnes interrogates our insistence upon narrated meaning. In Nightwood, Barnes put melancholia to work at the very center of the novel: displacing “proper” narrative form, revealing fundamental compulsions to retell, read, and know.}

  abstract = {Introduction. One problem with creating universal information systems has been the presence of unacknowledged bias. Systems that are designed for discrete discourse communities, as in the domain analytic approach described by Hjørland and Albrechtsen (1995), can be seen as a response to such problems of bias.  Method. Through an extended analysis, this paper contends, however, that bias remains in the domain analytic approach. The root of this bias lies in the continued sense, in the writings on domain analysis, that the representation of knowledge structures is a type of scientific discovery: the documentation of a true reality, as opposed to an actively designed interpretation of reality.  Results. This paper suggests that a more inclusive approach to information system design might involve the definition and justification of a particular stance toward the information, as appropriate for the use context of a particular system. Conclusions. If we cannot eliminate bias, then we should instead attempt to be more responsible about it and explicitly decide on and defend the perspectives represented in information systems. According to this type of approach, which draws on the idea of situated knowledges as expressed by Donna Haraway, the freedom to define a particular perspective for one situation also enables the definition of alternative stances for other design situations, allowing a diversity of opinions to flower. From this perspective, the design of information systems is both a creative and a critical task.}

  abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:             Introduction  Rita Felski   This special issue of New Literary History explores the relevance of Bruno Latour’s work for the humanities in two distinct yet related ways. First, how might this work reinvigorate or reorient literary studies, art history, religious studies, or other disciplines in the humanities? And second, how does it speak to “humanities discourse”—that is to say, the countless lamentations, perorations, jeremiads, diagnoses, and defenses of the humanities that have appeared in recent years, and that constitute a genre in their own right? Latour’s work, as we will see, gives us a rather different perspective on this flood of commentary and metacommentary. Some of the standard defenses of the humanities—they make us more human! they teach us to be critical thinkers!—start to sound hollow, and we find ourselves reaching for other argumentative weapons and diplomatic tools. Let’s begin with a thought experiment: what exactly would be lost if we lost the humanities? Such a question invites us to imagine an experience of loss and to anticipate the reactions triggered by this loss.1 Only in the gray early morning light, when a lover departs in a taxi for the last time, are we suddenly made aware of the depth and intensity of our passion. So too, perhaps we can more fully appreciate why the humanities are irreplaceable by contemplating the prospect of their nonexistence. According to one influential line of thought, the loss of the humanities would mean, above all, the loss of critique. Critique, of course, has a long history that can be spun in diverse ways; as a synonym for Socratic or Kantian modes of philosophical questioning, for example, or to denote an adversarial and agonistic style of political argument. This latter use of the term, especially, has gained increased traction in the humanities in the last half century. Critique, in this sense, typically includes the following elements: a spirit of skeptical reflection or outright condemnation; an emphasis on its own precarious position vis-à-vis overbearing social forces; the claim to be engaged in some kind of radical intellectual and/or political work; and the assumption that whatever is not critical must therefore be uncritical.2 This association of the humanities with critique has recently been underscored by Terry Eagleton in a widely noted essay. “Are the humanities [End Page 215] about to disappear?” Eagleton wonders. He goes on: “What we have witnessed in our own time is the death of universities as centres of critique. Since Margaret Thatcher, the role of academia has been to service the status quo, not challenge it in the name of justice, tradition, imagination, human welfare, the free play of the mind or alternative visions of the future.”3 The declining role and influence of the humanities is tied, Eagleton declares, to the evisceration of critical thinking. Thanks to an increasingly instrumental and market-driven view of knowledge, underwritten by ballooning bureaucracies that cast professors and students in the roles of managers and consumers, the concerns of the humanities are made to seem ever more peripheral. We can endorse Eagleton’s anger and frustration about the sidelining of the humanities without subscribing to the terms of his defense. Indeed, his own words might give us pause, for they do not support his argument as well as he might think. Some of the ideas he invokes—imagination, perhaps; tradition, certainly—are hardly synonymous with critique; indeed, they have often been seen as its antithesis. “Critique” may be too broad-brush a term to help us think through the various practices of the humanities. As Helen Small writes: “The work of the humanities is frequently descriptive, or appreciative, or imaginative, or provocative, or speculative, more than it is critical.”4 That intellectuals so often invoke “critique” as a guiding ethos and principle speaks to the grip of an either/or mindset: the fear that if one is not declaring one’s opposition to the status quo, one is therefore being co-opted by it. The practices of academic life may turn out to be more messy, more ambiguous, and more interesting. Is it possible to voice a defense of the humanities that is not anchored...}

  abstract = {The hermeneutics of suspicion is a term coined by Paul Ricoeur to describe the practice of reading texts against the grain to expose their repressed or hidden meanings. This essay examines the distinctive features of such a hermeneutics as they have shaped literary theory and criticism in recent decades. Suspicious reading, it proposes, is not only an intellectual exercise in demystification, but also a critical style and scholarly sensibility that offers specific pleasures. These pleasures include the aesthetic and ethical satisfactions of fashioning detective-fiction-style plots. The literary critic, like the detective, interprets clues, establishes causal connections, and identifies a guilty party: namely, the literary work accused of whitewashing or concealing social oppression. Deconstructionist critics like Shoshana Felman seek to expose the dangers of such a suspicious hermeneutics but remain thoroughly entangled in the very method they seek to repudiate. The goal of the essay, then, is not to critique and be suspicious of suspicion. Rather, it seeks to take the hermeneutics of suspicion seriously and to understand why it has proved so attractive to contemporary scholars. At the same time, it also suggests that the present-day ubiquity and predictability of this critical method makes its claims to intellectual novelty or political boldness ever harder to sustain.},

Beginning with the medieval revival of Roman law, this study reveals the evolution of arguments concerning the right to occupy through the School of Salamanca, the foundation of American colonies, seventeenth-century natural law theories, Enlightenment philosophers, eighteenth-century American colonies and the new American republic, writings of nineteenth-century jurists, debates over the carve up of Africa, twentieth-century discussions of the status of Polar territories, and the period of decolonisation},

Data ethics builds on the foundation provided by computer and information ethics but, at the same time, it refines the approach endorsed so far in this research field, by shifting the level of abstraction of ethical enquiries, from being information-centric to being data-centric. This shift brings into focus the different moral dimensions of all kinds of data, even data that never translate directly into information but can be used to support actions or generate behaviours, for example. It highlights the need for ethical analyses to concentrate on the content and nature of computational operations—the interactions among hardware, software and data—rather than on the variety of digital technologies that enable them. And it emphasizes the complexity of the ethical challenges posed by data science. Because of such complexity, data ethics should be developed from the start as a macroethics, that is, as an overall framework that avoids narrow, ad hoc approaches and addresses the ethical impact and implications of data science and its applications within a consistent, holistic and inclusive framework. Only as a macroethics will data ethics provide solutions that can maximize the value of data science for our societies, for all of us and for our environments.

  abstract = {Geographers have produced a host of different interpretations of the landscape. In this essay I aim to participate in such an endeavour by linking Mikhail Bakhtin's work to geographical inquiry. Concepts such as dialogism, heteroglossia, the chronotope, and polyphony are only a sample of his valuable contributions to the theory of knowledge, alongside the 'carnival' sense of the world that conveys a pathos of shift and change, of death and renewal. 'Carnival' sums up the rituals and diverse festivities that reflect popular culture. Together these notions lead to a better understanding of otherness and alterity. This understanding provides the basis for a conceptual landscape that indicates the moment and situation (time - space) of a dialogue whose outcome is never a neutral exchange. Landscape thus becomes not only 'graphically visible' in space but also 'narratively visible' in time through dialogue.},

While focusing primarily on the class struggle, many of the approximately 100 instances of the genre address issues of race and gender. The proletarian novel can be analyzed in subcategories defined by subject matter – for example, strike novels, novels about individuals and groups coming to class consciousness – and by form – for example, fictional autobiographies, collective novels. In somewhat altered form, the proletarian novel continues as a class-conscious, anti-capitalist presence in current literary production.},

Implied is a belief that the mixing of qualitative                 and quantitative methods will produce the ‘best of both worlds’.                 This assumption, combined with inherent promises of inclusiveness, takes on a                 reality and certainty in research findings that serves well the powerful nexus of                 economic restraint and evidence-based practice. I argue that the use of the terms                 ‘qualitative’ and ‘quantitative’ as                 normative descriptors reinforces their binary positioning, effectively marginalising                 the methodological diversity within them. Ideologically, mixed methods covers for                 the continuing hegemony of positivism, albeit in its more moderate, postpositivist                 form. If naively interpreted, mixed methods could become the preferred approach in                 the teaching and doing of research. Rather than the promotion of more co-operative                 and complex designs for increasingly complex social and health issues, economic and                 administrative pressures may lead to demands for the ‘quick fix’                 that mixed methods appears to offer.},

The other Hegel tarries with the "negative" he (which or variously calls "non-being", "otherness""difference") to disrupt this plenary subject to Marx's reading of a Hegel who is different-in-himself lends~Grundrisse its electric buzz: seizing Hegel's "negative" as the~not-value of value, i.e. "labor", Marx explains how capital must continuously enroll labor to its will in order to survive and expand. But this enrollment is never given; hence, despite its emergent structure of necessity, capital's return to itself as "self-animating value" is never free of peril. The most speculative aspect of my argument is that the figure of "labor" in~Grundrisse, because of its radically open formulation as not-value, anticipates the elusive subject of difference in postcolonial theory, "the subaltern"2014that figure which evades dialectical integration, and is in some ontological way inscrutable to the "master". Unexpectedly, then~Grundrisse gives us a way to think beyond the epistemic and geographic power of "Europe".}

Writers of urban fiction such as Robert Blake Fuller, Theodore Dreiser, and Upton Sinclair were trying to make sense of the modern city. In the 1920s the urban ecologists at the Chicago School of Sociology attempted to do the same. Common to both literary and theoretical discourses was the recourse to organic metaphors to describe the city. In this paper I will explore the intertextuality of these discourses. In addition, other cultural projects of the period, including the 1893 World Columbian exposition, Jane Addams' Hull House, and Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of the City will be considered. This paper is organized into three parts: first, I examine the points of view adopted by the urban writers; second, I explore the spatial constructions of the city; and third, I analyse the organic metaphors that predominate in these literatures. The moralism inherent to both theory and fiction is examined. I conclude with some comments and criticisms of these canonical voices, suggesting the importance of alternative visions of the city.},

Drawing upon Doreen Massey's emphasis on notions of [`]possibility', [`]chance', [`]undecidability' and [`]happenstance', we argue for an engagement with approaches in the humanities that have addressed such issues directly. We review previous uses of counterfactual method in historical geography, particularly as related to cliometrics and the [`]new economic history' of the 1960s, but argue that a recent upsurge of interest in other disciplines indicates alternative ways that [`]what-if' experiments might work in the sub-discipline. Recent counterfactual work outside of geography has had a notably spatial cast, often thinking through the nature of alternative worlds, or using counterfactual strategies that are explicitly concerned with space as well as temporal causality. We set out possible agendas for counterfactual work in historical geography. These include: consideration of the historical geographies within existing counterfactual writings and analyses; suggestions for distinctive ways that historical geographers might think and write counterfactually, including experiments in geographies of happenstance, and the exploration of more-than-human possibilities; analyses of the geography of and in counterfactual writing; and study of the political, ethical and emotional demands that counterfactuals make. This discussion and framework provides an extended introduction to this special feature on counterfactual geographies.},

Drawing upon detailed case studies of two asylum-seeking activist organisations in the UK, the connections between imaginations of the state, spatial strategies towards institutionalised authority, and the pros and cons of these strategies for activism itself are examined. Through these cases, the paper emphasises the importance of everyday theories about the state not only for understanding what the state is, but also for understanding how relationships with the state are formed and points towards the constructive power of imaginations of the state in their own right.},

  abstract = {Interpretation is widely regarded as the core activity of literary studies. Still, the appropriate balance between the plurality and the limitation of possible interpretations is a non-trivial issue. Whereas it is sensible to accept that literary texts can generally have various meanings, it should not be possible to attribute any kind of meaning to a text. Therefore, while interpreters must be allowed to disagree in their analyses, it must at the same time be possible to review whether a disagreement is actually based on adequate reasons like, for example, textual ambiguity or polyvalence. In this paper, we propose a best practice model as one effective means to review disagreement in accordance with literary studies principles. The model has been developed during the collaborative, computer-assisted annotation of literary texts in a project in which short stories have been analyzed narratologically. The examination of inconsistently annotated text passages revealed four types of reasons for disagreement: misinterpretations, deficient definitions of the categories of analysis, dependencies of the relevant categories on preliminary analyses, and textual ambiguity/polyvalence. We argue that only disagreements based on textual ambiguity are considered legitimate or valuable cases of disagreement, whereas the other three types of disagreement can be resolved in a systematic way.},

  abstract = {[The reputation of Djuna Barnes's Nightwood as a work of "marginal" modernism is complicated by its affinities with the aesthetics of high modernism, a fact signaled by its role as the inspiration of Joseph Frank's theory of spatial form. At once emblematic and eccentric, the novel is devoted to both recognition and obscurity. Nightwood enacts this paradox through a strategy of queer ekphrasis that aestheticizes moments of loss, giving aesthetic form to experiences of stigma in order to "dazzle" them. Attending to Barnes's spatial form will forward debates about modernism and queer theory, suggesting a more useful vocabulary for both: an account of the aesthetic that is neither wholly subversive nor wholly conservative and a nuanced account of queerness that does not subscribe to either total negation or total affirmation.]}

  abstract = {" Encompassing new technologies, research methods, and opportunities for collaborative scholarship and open-source peer review, as well as innovative ways of sharing knowledge and teaching, the digital humanities promises to transform the liberal arts--and perhaps the university itself. Indeed, at a time when many academic institutions are facing austerity budgets, digital humanities programs have been able to hire new faculty, establish new centers and initiatives, and attract multimillion-dollar grants. Clearly the digital humanities has reached a significant moment in its brief history. But what sort of moment is it? Debates in the Digital Humanities brings together leading figures in the field to explore its theories, methods, and practices and to clarify its multiple possibilities and tensions. From defining what a digital humanist is and determining whether the field has (or needs) theoretical grounding, to discussions of coding as scholarship and trends in data-driven research, this cutting-edge volume delineates the current state of the digital humanities and envisions potential futures and challenges. At the same time, several essays aim pointed critiques at the field for its lack of attention to race, gender, class, and sexuality; the inadequate level of diversity among its practitioners; its absence of political commitment; and its preference for research over teaching.Together, the essays in Debates in the Digital Humanities--which will be published both as a printed book and later as an ongoing, open-access website--suggest that the digital humanities is uniquely positioned to contribute to the revival of the humanities and academic life.Contributors: Bryan Alexander, National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education; Rafael Alvarado, U of Virginia; Jamie "Skye" Bianco, U of Pittsburgh; Ian Bogost, Georgia Institute of Technology; Stephen Brier, CUNY Graduate Center; Daniel J.

We demonstrate gradual, unnoted shifts in the themes and vocabularies of scholarship—including the long rise of new subjects (like violence); we show the surprising novelty of central theoretical concepts; and we explore transformations in the shared rationales for literary scholarship that exceed the boundaries of conventional labels like “New Criticism” and “New Historicism.” Though our method uses computational tools, we not claim to provide a definitive or objective perspective on disciplinary history; instead, our approach, like the related methods of content analysis in the social sciences, allows us to pursue nuanced interpretations of the language of many texts at once.},

  abstract = {The landscape of Internet mapping technologies has changed dramatically since 2005. New techniques are being used and new terms have been invented and entered the lexicon such as: mash-ups, crowdsourcing, neogeography and geostack. A whole range of websites and communities from the commercial Google Maps to the grassroots OpenStreetMap, and applications such as Platial, also have emerged. In their totality, these new applications represent a step change in the evolution of the area of Internet geographic applications (which some have termed the GeoWeb). The nature of this change warrants an explanation and an overview, as it has implications both for geographers and the public notion of Geography. This article provides a critical review of this newly emerging landscape, starting with an introduction to the concepts, technologies and structures that have emerged over the short period of intense innovation. It introduces the non-technical reader to them, suggests reasons for the neologism, explains the terminology, and provides a perspective on the current trends. Case studies are used to demonstrate this Web Mapping 2.0 era, and differentiate it from the previous generation of Internet mapping. Finally, the implications of these new techniques and the challenges they pose to geographic information science, geography and society at large are considered.},

  abstract = {This paper criticizes two forms of philosophical materialism that adopt opposite strategies but end up in the same place. Both hold that individual entities must be banished from philosophy. The first kind is ground floor materialism, which attempts to dissolve all objects into some deeper underlying basis; here, objects are seen as too shallow to be the truth. The second kind is first floor materialism, which treats objects as naive fictions gullibly posited behind the direct accessibility of appearances or relations; here, objects are portrayed as too deep to be the truth. One major thesis of this paper is that these two forms of materialism are parasitical on one another and need each other’s resources to make sense of the world. The second major thesis is that both forms of materialism thereby stand condemned, and that philosophy must be rebuilt from the individual objects that the two forms of materialism disdain. These points are made through a detailed consideration of the book Every Thing Must Go by the analytic structural realists James Ladyman and Don Ross, which has gained a surprising following among some speculative realists in continental philosophy. Ladyman and Ross claim to preserve objects by treating them as “real patterns”, but they do so at the price of destroying their autonomous reality. Furthermore, they are unable to tell us whether the mathematical structures they see as the basis of human knowledge are also the basis of reality itself. In short, their ontology is scientism for scientism’s sake (or ‘Bunsen burner realism’) and must be eliminated in favor of a genuine realist metaphysics of objects.},

DeLanda conceives of the world as made up of countless layers of assemblages, irreducible to their parts and never dissolved into larger organic wholes.

It also criticizes his movement away from singular individuals toward disembodied attractors and topological structures lying outside all specific beings. While endorsing DeLanda’s realism, I reject his shift from the actual to the virtual.},

A brief summary is given of Latour’s intellectual career, including his recent transition from actor-network theory to the “modes of existence” project. An asymmetry in Latour’s approach is also identified: though he abolishes both nature and culture as distinct realms of being, he retains and expands the “foritself” of culture even while abolishing the “in-itself” of nature. An opposite problem is identified in Hodder’s approach, which takes account of the virtue of the nonrelationality of things, but which retains the very nature/culture dualism that Latour had succeeded in dismantling. This leads Hodder in the direction of an untenable politics guided by the model of prehistoric humans uncontaminated by excessive dependence on things.},

Lovecraft serves as a sort of mascot for the \&ldquo;speculative\&rdquo; part of  speculative realism, since his grotesque semi-Euclidean monsters  symbolize the rejection of everyday common sense to which speculative  realism aspires. The \&ldquo;realism\&rdquo; part of speculative realism was aimed not  at idealism, which few people openly defend today, but at what Quentin  Meillassoux calls \&ldquo;correlationism\&rdquo;: the view that philosophy cannot  speak of human or world in isolation, but only of a primal correlation  or rapport between the two.1 The goal of the speculative realists was to bring the  things-in-themselves back into discussion, though there was ferocious  disagreement amongst us as to how these things could be talked about:  whether the things themselves remained inaccessible to direct access as  in Kantian and Heideggerian philosophy, or whether they could be the  object of direct mathematical insight as for Alain Badiou and his  circle.  This diversity of opinion led to an early break-up for the  speculative realist movement, which quickly broke into numerous splinter  groups bearing little resemblance to one another. In an earlier essay  published in this journal,2 I discussed Meillassoux\&rsquo;s \&ldquo;speculative materialism\&rdquo;; a more detailed  account can now be found in my recently published book on his  philosophy.3 In this essay I will discuss the \&ldquo;object-oriented\&rdquo; branch of  speculative realism, with which I have a more direct personal  involvement as one of its founders. One of the primary differences  between speculative materialism and object-oriented ontology (OOO)  concerns the point just mentioned. Both schools are united in their  resistance to the banal claims of continental philosophy to stand  \&ldquo;beyond\&rdquo; the realism/anti-realism dispute (Husserl and Heidegger,  unfortunately, must take the blame for such assertions). Yet there  remains a question as to what extent reality can be  known . Are the things-in-themselves  directly  accessible to humans or not? Simply put, the answer of speculative  materialism is yes, while the answer of object-oriented ontology is no.   The question can be restated as follows. We might summarize the  philosophical position of Kant by saying that he makes two basic claims:   1. Human knowledge is finite, since the things-in-themselves can be thought but never known.   2. The human-world relation (mediated by space, time, and the  categories) is philosophically privileged over every other sort of  relation; philosophy is primarily about human access to the world, or at  least must take this access as its starting point.   Object-oriented philosophy agrees with the first Kantian point and  disagrees with the second, while for speculative materialism it is  precisely the reverse. For object-oriented philosophy, the  things-in-themselves remain forever beyond our grasp, but not because of  a specifically  human  failure to reach them. Instead, relations  in general  fail to gasp their relata, and in this sense the ghostly  things-in-themselves haunt inanimate causal relations no less than the  human-world relation, which no longer stands at the center of  philosophy.   For speculative materialism it is exactly the opposite. Here, humans  remain at the center of philosophy, though their knowledge is no longer  finite. Humans are capable of the absolute; any qualities that can be  mathematized are primary qualities that can be known absolutely, with no  dark residue lying behind them. And since this \&ldquo;absolute\&rdquo; exists even  when we sleep or die, speculative materialism often claims to be a form  of realism rather than a transcendental idealism. The present essay is  confined to the internal challenges of the object-oriented approach, the  one I prefer myself.   \&nbsp;    1. Objects    In the beginning, philosophy was an  anti -object-oriented  enterprise. Normal human experience seems to confront a world broken  into units: natural objects such as flowers, stars, and wild animals,  artificial objects ranging from pirate ships to copper mines, and both  the natural and artificial kinds ranging widely in size from tiny to  gigantic. Despite our constant experience of objects in daily life,  philosophy began in the pre-Socratic era as an effort to find a more  basic reality lying beneath all these entities. For various  pre-Socratics the world was made of immortal elements such as water or  air, of four elements in combination mixed by love and hate, of atoms  swerving in the void, or of a formless  apeiron  rumbling beneath  all tangible things. No matter which of these is chosen as the  foundation of the world, the familiar individual entities of the cosmos  are not treated as fundamental. In this way all the flowers, stars, wild  animals, pirate ships, and copper mines, not to mention the objects of  religion and flat-out superstition, are  undermined . They are  treated as composite things built of something more fundamental; in the  pre-Socratic period, it was simply a question of deciding what was the  most fundamental element. Nor is this attitude confined to ancient  pre-Socratic times, since we find the same thing even now: in the crude  present-day materialism that holds objects to be nothing more than  conglomerates of molecules, atoms, quarks and electrons, or strings; in  philosophies of the so-called \&ldquo;pre-individual,\&rdquo; which treats the world  as a semi-articulate lump arbitrarily carved into pieces by the human  intellect; and in even more recent philosophies that treat the world as a  mathematical structure that breaks into isolated \&ldquo;real patterns\&rdquo; only  at different levels of observational scale.4 Let\&rsquo;s use the term \&ldquo;undermining\&rdquo; for those theories which think that  objects are too shallow to be the truth. Here, the real action  supposedly unfolds at a deeper layer than individual things, whether  that of tiny elemental pieces or of a semi-liquid, holistic quasi-lump.   But for those who wish to denigrate objects as the basic theme of  philosophy, there is another way to do it. Rather than undermining  objects by dissolving them downward into some component element, we can  dissolve them upward or \&ldquo;overmine\&rdquo; them, to coin a new English term.  Rather than viewing objects as too shallow to be the truth, we can treat  them as too falsely deep to be the truth. This happens whenever a  philosophy tells us that an object is nothing more than how it appears  to the observer; or an arbitrary bundling of immediately perceived  qualities; or when it tells us that there are only \&ldquo;events,\&rdquo; not  underlying substances; or that objects are real only insofar as they  perceive or affect other things. In all these cases, objects are treated  as a useless hypothesis, a false depth lying beneath the immediate  givens of consciousness or the concrete events of the world. As I have  written elsewhere, it is also possible to combine overmining and  undermining in a single philosophy. This happens most often in  scientific materialism, which undermines when it finds tinier components  from which our everyday objects are built, but overmines when it thinks  these tiny pieces are nothing over and above their mathematizable  properties.   In short, a large part of present-day philosophy is devoted to  contempt for individual objects, which it denounces as the gullible  fantasies of common sense\&ndash; or \&ldquo;folk psychology,\&rdquo; as it is arrogantly  phrased by a number of scientistic hacks. The main counter-tradition to  undermining and overmining is, of course, the Aristotelian tradition.  Here individual entities are treated as the primary substance, which  both undermining and overmining philosophies enjoy mocking as \&ldquo;mid-sized  physical objects.\&rdquo; But it seems to me that the Aristotelian tradition  is closer to the truth than the other two. Admittedly, there are  numerous features of traditional substance that we might not wish to  accept. Consider the philosophy of Leibniz, for instance. While Leibniz  distinguishes between substance and aggregate, we do not have to agree  with him that a mushroom is a substance but an army is not. While  Leibniz holds that every substance is eternal, we can follow Aristotle\&rsquo;s  brave decision and recognize  destructible  substances such as  plants, insects, and humans, which he was the first in Ancient Greece to  do. Nor is it necessary to agree with Leibniz that substances have no  windows and do not affect one another directly (though in fact I  do  agree with Leibniz on this point, if not with the others).   Anyhow, we can see that Aristotle, the Scholastics, and Leibniz, with  their primary substances and substantial forms, make up an early  object-oriented school surrounded on both sides by legions of  underminers and overminers who reject individual entities as the basic  stuff of the world. But I myself came to that tradition indirectly,  through a less obvious but more contemporary tradition of  object-oriented thought: phenomenology. Here I mean both Husserl and  Heidegger, each of them making a different innovation in the philosophy  of objects. We should speak briefly about these two different but deeply  related currents.   Like Brentano before him, Husserl is concerned with the sphere of  intentionality, or \&ldquo;immanent objectivity.\&rdquo; Suspending all theories about  an extra-phenomenal outside world, Husserl analyzes the phenomena as  they appear to us, with attention to the subtlest contours of our  dealings with phenomena such as blackbirds or mailboxes. There can be no  question that Husserl is an idealist to the core\&mdash;even in the  Logical Investigations\&mdash; for him it makes no sense to say that there could be realities not observable  in principle  by consciousness. Nonetheless, Husserl often  feels  like a realist. The atmosphere of his writings is one in which  individual things seem opaque and resistant, not entirely exhausted by  their appearance in the mind. By contrast, one rarely or never has this  sense when reading someone like Hegel, at least not when it comes to  individual entities. Despite the scholarly precision of his thinking,  Husserl often seems puzzled by the many facets of concrete individual  things, rather than merely overmining them and reducing them to their  appearance in consciousness. This paradox must be considered briefly.   Like Brentano, Husserl is focused on intentionality, which means: on  objects lying before the mind. All perception, judgment, love, and hate  is perception, judgment, love, or hate  of   some object .  This object is never a concealed thing-in-itself lying beyond access,  but purely immanent: intentionality means immanent objectivity. But in  one of the most important passages of the  Logical Investigations ,  Husserl takes a distance from Brentano when determining exactly what  this means. Whereas Brentano views intentionality as a matter of  \&ldquo;experienced contents,\&rdquo; for Husserl intentionality consists of  \&ldquo;object-giving acts.\&rdquo; The difference may sound dry and technical, but I  would call it Husserl\&rsquo;s most important contribution to philosophy. To  say that our encounter with an apple consists of \&ldquo;experienced contents\&rdquo;  is to say that we experience hundreds or thousands of qualities on a  democratic plane, all of them pressed together into a single thing  called an apple. The exact shape of the apple, its temperature in the  hand, its degree of hardness, the exact profile it displays in this very  moment, its precise momentary sweetness\&mdash;all these are equally qualities  of the apple as an experienced content. Husserl views the situation  differently. For Husserl, the experience of an apple is an object-giving  act  quite apart  from the list of qualities it now seems to  possess. We can toss the apple in the air, view it from numerous angles,  observe it in various degrees of sunlight, describe it in moods of  euphoria and in crippling depression, but for us it remains the same  apple in all these cases. To use Husserl\&rsquo;s famous technical term, there  are countless \&ldquo;adumbrations\&rdquo; ( Abschattungen ) of the apple. The  apple itself is not obtained by adding up all the different surfaces and  profiles it can display; rather, the apple is there from the start as  an enduring unit that exhibits numerous different facets at different  times.   Against all the empiricist theories, Husserl establishes a permanent  rift between intentional objects and the various intentional qualities  they might have at any given time. In the realm of conscious experience,  objects are not \&ldquo;bundles of qualities,\&rdquo; but units lying deeper than any  display of surface qualities. In short, there is a permanent tension in  the sphere of intentional experience between objects and their  qualities. It seems to me that this is why Husserl  feels  like a  realist: for him, intentional objects are not just bundles of qualities  lying before the mind, but places of fracture where an object grinds up  against its own qualities, displaying different qualities at different  times even while remaining distinct from them. As far as I am aware,  this is also something completely new in the history of philosophy. It  is true that Husserl cuts off the real world, collapsing everything into  an immanent phenomenal sphere. But precisely in so doing, he is able to  discover a previously unknown drama  within  the intentional  sphere, which is broken up into objects with constantly shifting faces.  Instead of calling them intentional objects, I prefer to call them  \&ldquo;sensual\&rdquo; objects for at least two reasons. For one thing, the phrase  \&ldquo;intentional objects\&rdquo; is dry and technical, unpleasant to repeat as  frequently as it needs to be when we discuss such topics. But more  importantly, the word \&ldquo;intentional\&rdquo; is used ambiguously; many  philosophers use it to refer to the object lying  outside  the  mental sphere, a distant object at which our thoughts \&ldquo;point.\&rdquo; But that  is not what Brentano and Husserl mean when they speak of intentionality,  and thus the phrase \&ldquo;intentional object\&rdquo; often leads to confusion. For  this reason, we can speak instead of a permanent tension between sensual  objects and sensual qualities, or between an apple that remains the  same apple from one moment to the next, and the wildly fluctuating  kaleidoscope of its surface features.   Here we can see how the strife between object and quality unfolds in  the purely sensual arena described by phenomenology. And this brings us  to Heidegger. If Husserl turns philosophy into a description of how  things appear in consciousness, we know that for Heidegger our primary  mode of dealing with things  is not  through their appearing to  consciousness. The place where Heidegger breaks with Husserl is the  famous tool-analysis published in  Being and Time , but first  presented to his Freiburg students eight years earlier, in 1919. A brief  summary will be enough for our purposes here. What is key for Heidegger  is that insofar as something is present to consciousness, it is merely  present-at-hand ( vorhanden ). But what is present to our minds in  this way is only a tiny proportion of the entities with which we are  involved. The air we breathe, the floor on which we stand, the heart,  kidneys, and lungs that function within us, all tend  not  to be present insofar as they are doing their work. As every reader of Heidegger knows, it is usually  broken  equipment that comes to conscious attention. Equipment in its seamless  functioning is ready-to-hand rather than present-at-hand,  zuhanden  rather than  vorhanden .   A few additional points need to be made. In the first place, the tool-analysis is not limited to a specific  kind  of entity called \&ldquo;tools\&rdquo; in the narrow sense, which would include  hammers, drills, cars, guns, and computers, while excluding family,  friends, house pets, and God. Instead,  every  entity has both  sides: ready-to-hand and present-at-hand. This is not because we \&ldquo;use\&rdquo;  our family and friends in the same way that we exploit hammers and  drills, but because our friends no less than our tools are deeper than  any possible access we might have to them. The hammer-in-itself is not  the same as our perception of it at any given moment. But the same holds  for people, and just as much for the cryptic, concealed God who  communicates only by signs.   In the second place, we need to avoid the frequent reading of the  tool-analysis as equivalent to a distinction between praxis and theory,  as if Heidegger were merely telling us that all perception of hammers  and theories about hammers were grounded in a pre-theoretical use of  them. The problem with this interpretation is clear enough: for if tools  are always deeper than our perceptions or theories of them, they are  also deeper than our use of them. To sit in a chair is no closer a  relation to the chair than thinking about it is; in both cases, the  chair itself retains an unexhausted surplus deeper than our relation  with it. It is not a difference between theory and praxis, but a  difference between the things themselves and our relations with them.  But there is one more step to the argument, one that Heidegger never  considered. The failure of both theory and praxis to exhaust the things  of the world is not some tragic mental feature of humans and a few smart  animals. Instead, it is a limitation of relationality in general.  Objects withdraw from each other in the case of inanimate causation no  less than in the human use of tools. Rain striking a tin roof does not  make intimate contact with the reality of the tin any more than the  monkeys on the roof or the impoverished resident of the tin-roofed shack  are able to do. Let it simply be added that the withdrawal of objects  from one another in causal relations turns causality into a serious  philosophical problem. For if objects cannot touch directly, then how do  they influence one another at all? There must be some third term, some  medium through which they interact. Causation must be indirect or  vicarious rather than direct and immediate.   The final point to be made is that Heidegger\&rsquo;s withdrawn,  sub-phenomenal world of tool-beings must be made up of individual  things. This apparently runs counter to the spirit of  Being and Time , where all tools seem to melt together into a single system: \&ldquo;there is no such thing as \&lsquo;an\&rsquo; equipment,\&rdquo;5 as Heidegger puts it. This even seems true in his later writings on  \&ldquo;the thing,\&rdquo; where the concealed portion of individual entities is  called \&ldquo;earth,\&rdquo; and the earth is generally treated as a monolithic lump  rather than a set of fully articulated individuals.6 It might seem as though the subterranean world of being were a  rumbling, unified chunk broken into pieces only by human consciousness, a  conclusion drawn by Emmanuel Levinas during his ardently Heideggerian  phase in the 1940\&rsquo;s.7 But this is impossible. Hammers break in different ways from drills,  which break in different ways from hearts, kidneys, and lungs. The  shocks and surprises generated by failing equipment are not random. The  world is not a single lump broken into pieces by consciousness, but  consists of individual pieces from the start.   To summarize, we can definitely say that for Heidegger there is a  real sub-phenomenal world in a way that is not true for Husserl. By  pushing Heidegger a bit beyond what he wanted to say, we can also  conclude that this real world is made up of individual objects that are  withdrawn from all theoretical, practical, and even causal access. And  furthermore, each of these real objects must have specific real  qualities. For as Leibniz observed,8 even the simple unified monads must have diverse qualities: otherwise  they would be interchangeable, with hammers equally able to function as  drills, kidneys, dolphins, or monkeys depending on the whim of the  observer. But this is ridiculous.   When considering Husserl, we found that the sensual realm was broken  into both objects and qualities. By pushing Heidegger\&rsquo;s tool-analysis  just slightly, we find an analogous distinction between real objects and  their real qualities. We thus have a world made of four terms: real  objects, real qualities, sensual objects, sensual qualities. I have  often made the case that this is what Heidegger was aiming at with his  mysterious theory of  das Geviert  (\&ldquo;the fourfold\&rdquo;) and will not  repeat that case here. What is more important is that we now have a  model to play with that points to a number of puzzles and to possible  gaps in our understanding, much like any scientific model. Let\&rsquo;s draw a  few more conclusions from this idea before getting into some of the  trickier questions it raises.   \&nbsp;    2. The Fourfold and Vicarious Causation    At first the model seems to consist of four terms linked by just two  tensions. Within the confines of experience, there is a strife between  sensual objects and their shifting sensual qualities, precisely as  described by Husserl. Even if I sit motionless before a bowl of pears  and apples, these objects vary in profile depending on the angle and  distance at which I sit, and vary in color depending on the increase or  decrease of afternoon shadow in the room, or the lamplight and candles  in which they are viewed after nightfall; their imagined tastiness  alters as my mood and appetite alter. This is true all the more if I  actively stand and maneuver through the room to view them from  dramatically different vantage points, and they vary all the more for  living species of different size and capacity, whether it be fruit flies  or even monkeys. But within certain limits, these shifting features and  contours and possibilities of objects do not turn them into  different  objects. If we consider that they are merely caricatures, exaggerated  versions of real pears and apples, then we allude to a dark subterranean  underworld of beings that no perception and no relation can ever touch.  This underworld, too, is made of objects, but objects that exceed any  attempt to grasp them. Since we deduce that they must be individuals  rather than a single inarticulate or semi-articulate lump (for  otherwise, hammers and pears would not be able to surprise us in  specifically hammer-fashion and pear-manner), these real objects must  have qualities as well. But for the very same reason, there cannot be a  total  disconnection between these two realms. The real must be able to affect  the sensual, to surge up into the visual realm when tools break or by  other means. There must be various crossovers between these two  kingdoms\&mdash;some relation between real objects and sensual qualities, and  also between sensual objects and real qualities.   When speaking of Husserl, we have so far referred only to a strife  found only within the sensual realm. A sensual object has countless  adumbrations, countless sensual qualities, depending on the manner in  which it is observed. But Husserl already knows that there is more going  on than this. A pear, apple, or hammer not only bathes in a shifting  flux of qualities that portray it according to different adumbrations.  There are also truly  important  qualities that these objects must  have in order to remain what they are for us. Through the method of  eidetic variation, we strip away the noise and confetti of the  accidental profiles of a thing, and move toward some sense of what the  thing really  needs  in order to be what it is in the sensual  realm. True, Husserl thinks we can determine what these important  properties are through a kind of direct intellectual or essential  intuition, but we need not follow him on this point. Instead, we need  only agree that there is a distinction between the wild masquerade of a  thing\&rsquo;s surface appearance and the deeper, enduring apple-qualities that  the apple must retain for as long as we acknowledge it to be this very  apple. In this way we are led to see that the sensual object crosses  into the underworld through its possession of  real  qualities as  well. They are real because they withdraw from direct access no less  than efficient hammers or unnoticed lungs and kidneys do. In short,  Husserl\&rsquo;s intentional objects, which we can rename \&ldquo;sensual objects\&rdquo; for  the reasons mentioned earlier, are a remarkable crossroads where both  sensual and real qualities belong to the same sensual object, as if the  same planet had both visible and concealed moons. We now have a third  tension in our model, and the kingdoms of real and sensual are now  linked by a strange sort of bridge, crossing between shadow and light: a  rigorous scientific phenomenology generating the sort of strange  communicational infrastructure between real and unreal that might be  found in a fairy tale.   We should also ask about another unusual crossing, the one between  real objects and sensual qualities. And here we are in luck, since  Heidegger\&rsquo;s tool-analysis already points the way. When the hammer  shatters in our hand or the floor collapses beneath our feet, we  experience a kind of shock. These tool-beings no longer function  invisibly or simply withdraw unnoticed into shadow. Instead, numerous  features of the hammer now erupt explicitly into view. But contrary to  some readings of Heidegger, the hammer-object itself never does so. The  real hammer remains just as distant as ever before, even when it is  \&ldquo;broken.\&rdquo; Yet we are able to get a strange indirect sense of it anyway:  our minds do not encounter it directly, but  allude  to it, or see  the hammer without seeing it. The sensual qualities of the hammer no  longer just swirl around the phenomenal hammer in the mind, but seem to  be enslaved to a dark and hidden object that forever eludes our grasp  despite  its apparently obtrusive malfunction. And here we have the  fourth  tension in the model, one between real objects and sensual qualities.   There is no need here for a detailed discussion of Heidegger\&rsquo;s  fourfold, which is analogous but not identical to the quadruple  structure presented here. Although I have argued elsewhere that his  earth, sky, gods, and mortals have some analogy to the fourfold of real  objects, real qualities, sensual objects, and sensual qualities\&mdash;and have  argued further that Heidegger was on the scent of this model as early  as 1919\&mdash;what is really of interest are the four just-described  tensions  between the four poles, which he notices but never names. He speaks of  the interrelations between the four solely in poetic terms as mirrors,  dances, weddings, and songs. But we are now in a position to give them  more familiar names.   Few topics are of greater philosophical interest than time and space.  Daydreaming children dig for paradoxes here, as do Nobel Prize winners  and the criminally insane. But one common assumption among all these  groups seems to be that time and space are peerless queens, or special  dimensions of the cosmos devoid of any rivals. Kant sequesters them in  the Transcendental Aesthetic, on a different footing from the categories  of the understanding. But the polarized model of objects and qualities  allows us to integrate time and space into a wider theory in which they  are just two dimensions of the world among others.   According to the object-oriented model only the present exists: only  objects with their qualities, locked into whatever their duels of the  moment might be. In that sense, time seems to be illusory, though not  for the usual reason that time is just a fourth spatial dimension always  already present from the start. Instead, time does not exist simply  because only the present ever exists. Nonetheless, time as a lived  experience cannot be denied. We do not encounter a static frame of  reality, but seem to  feel  a passage of time. It is not a pure  chaos shifting wildly from one second to the next, since there is change  within apparent endurance. Sensual objects endure despite swirling  oscillations in their surface adumbrations, and this is precisely what  is meant by the experience of  time . Time can be defined as the tension between sensual objects and their sensual qualities.   Turning to space, one thing we know is that space cannot be located  entirely within the sensual realm. John Locke noted that our experience  of space is in some way an illusion. Everything in experience itself is  flat and equidistant, as seen from the fact that babies reach with equal  confidence for nearby toys, distant doorways, and the moon. Space is  not directly accessible to our senses, but inferred, and this skill must  be acquired at a specific point in child development. Despite what  Leibniz claims, space is not the realm of relation, but of both relation   and  non-relation. There would be no space if everything were  pressed directly up against us. Space means that there is something at a  distance from us, or withheld from us. But this is precisely what  Heidegger gives us in the tool-analysis. The hammer seems to be an  entirely domestic creature of our experience, until it breaks, and then  we recognize that there is a hammer-thing at some distance from us, not  entirely a creature of our experience. Space can be defined as the  tension between  real  objects and sensual qualities.   Perhaps it is now clear where we are going. Two tensions still  remain, and though they are less often the topic of romantic speculation  than are time and space, they belong on the same footing in the model  and hence deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. In Husserl we  found a third tension between sensual objects and their  real  qualities. Better yet, he already names it for us:  eidos .  Eidos  is the tension between a sensual object in experience and the withdrawn  pivotal features that we can only hint at rather than confronting  directly.   And finally, we should not forget the fourth tension, the only one  that has nothing to do with sensual experience at all: the tension  between real objects and real qualities, which we can simply deduce and  never experience at all. For this unity and duality in the heart of real  things, the traditional name is  essence , and there is no problem  with using it here. Essence is the tension between a real thing and its  real qualities. Once the terms are defined in this way, the world can  be viewed as the composite drama of time, space, essence, and eidos, so  that the object-oriented model of the world is further enriched. And in  fact, there are more than just these four. We also need to consider the  relations  between  real and sensual objects, and between real and  sensual qualities, as well as the relations between each of the four  poles and another of its own kind. That yields ten terms rather than  four, but there is no point developing the other six here. For those who  are interested, they are classified in my book  The Quadruple Object .9 For now we can leave open the question as to whether the coincidence of  this number ten with that of Aristotle\&rsquo;s ten categories is significant  or not.   Before moving to the conclusion, we can add three more interrelated  ideas to the mix. It was clear from the start that if real objects  withdraw from one another, they cannot affect one another directly.  Between real objects, only indirect or vicarious causation is possible.  There must be an intermediary between any two real objects, and two  points are evident here. First, this intermediary cannot itself be a  real  object, or there would simply be an endless process in which the  intermediary would need further intermediaries between itself and the  other objects, with the result that nothing would ever succeed in  touching anything else. In fact, this is the very criticism I made in  Prince of Networks  of the model of indirect causation offered by Latour in  Pandora\&rsquo;s Hope ,  in which actors can touch only by means of an intermediate actor, but  since all actors are of the exact same type for Latour, none of them is  truly capable of linking with anything else. Second, the intermediary  must be capable of making direct contact with both of the other terms.   Now, there is only one place where that can happen, and that is the  interior  of an object. This idea also comes from Husserl, though he never draws  the needed radical conclusions from it. Namely, Husserl points out the  paradox that intentionality is both one and two. On the one hand, in  intentionality there is I myself and then there is the pine tree, not  fusing together into a single lump, since the very fact that I am  perceiving it proves otherwise. But on the other hand, the intentional  relation between me and the pine tree must certainly be one, since we  are joined together in the perception rather than being painfully and  eternally separated. Given that perceptions are generally held to occur  inside the mind, the easy conclusion would be that I and the sensual  pine tree meet inside the mind. Husserl implies this point, and it is  stated quite openly in the altogether different (and completely  overrated) system of the neurophilosopher Thomas Metzinger. The problem  with this notion is that I myself cannot be simultaneously the whole of  the relation and merely half of it. The sensual object and I cannot meet  inside of me. Instead, our encounter occurs on the interior of the  relation  between me and the real tree (which must be indirect, but there is no  need to complicate things here). When the tree and I somehow form a  link, we become a new object; every relation forms a new real object.  This idea will be resisted for the simple reason that we normally think  of \&ldquo;objects\&rdquo; as solid physical things that hold together firmly, whereas  something like the relation between me and the tree seems much too  flimsy and transient. But remember, the definition of a real object is  simply a unified thing with specific qualities that withdraws from any  attempt to grasp it. The relation between me and the tree certainly  meets these criteria: the intentional relation must be one, or it could  not occur; it must have specific qualities, or it would be  interchangeable with any other relation; and it withdraws from any  attempt to grasp it, since I can never exhaustively grasp my own  relation with the tree, and  a fortiori  the tree can never do so.  So, what we have is the contact between me and the sensual tree on the  interior of the relation between me and the  real  one. The same  could be true in reverse, assuming the tree can perceive me in some  fashion, but this would be a different and parallel relation in which  the real tree encountered a sensual caricature of me. This may sound  like a mere panpsychist amusement as long as a tree is one of the two  terms. But consider a relation between two people, and the insight  suddenly becomes much more threatening. A relation between friends or  lovers then splits into two simultaneous but asymmetrical relations in  which each person deals with the other as if with a ghost. In any case,  we should add that this contact between a real object and a sensual one,  on the interior of a third object, is precisely the sort of direct  contact we are looking for. For contrary to some readings of Husserl,  intentional objects never \&ldquo;hide.\&rdquo; If I see an apple from one specific  angle, the apple is not \&ldquo;hidden\&rdquo; behind that current profile such that  we would have to run hysterically through all possible angles,  distances, and lighting conditions in order to add up all the profiles  to amass one apple. Instead, the apple is there from the start, from the  mere fact that I recognize it, and is simply covered over with fleeting  qualities like cheap jewelry or encrustations of brine.   Finally, we need to reject the idea that all objects must be in  relation with other objects at any given time. Although all objects are  made up of relations between component objects, it is not necessarily  the case that all objects enter into larger components in turn. While it  may be the case that there is an infinite regress of entities downward  into the depths of the world, it is not the case that there is an  infinite progress upward. There may be countless real entities that  exist (since their components have already formed them) which have not  yet managed to have an effect on anything else in the world. These can  be called sleeping objects, or  dormant  objects. They exist, but  currently affect nothing. Perhaps there are millions of entities that  remain in this state forever, passing through the world with the purely  unlucky fate of never affecting or being affected by anything else at  all.   \&nbsp;    3. Some Paradoxes     But right now I would like to consider the reverse case, that there may be things that  do  have an effect on other things but without being real. There is a  relevant term here that has reversed its meaning over time: \&ldquo;flat  ontology.\&rdquo; When the phrase \&ldquo;flat ontology\&rdquo; was used by Roy Bhaskar in  the early 1970\&rsquo;s in his book on the realist theory of science, it was a  polemical term. Namely, he used it to refer to theories that flatten the  world into its accessibility to human observers; it was a dismissive  phrase aimed at positivism, not a flattering description of realism. The  meaning of the phrase was reversed in 2006 by Bhaskar\&rsquo;s admirer Manuel  DeLanda. For DeLanda, \&ldquo;flat ontology\&rdquo; simply means that all entities  must be treated alike. That it to say, it is an  anti -reductionist  term, such that armies, cities, and herds of cattle might be just as  real as steel girders and atoms of potassium. \&ldquo;Flat\&rdquo; has now reversed  its meaning: rather than referring to a world without levels in which  everything inhabits the realm of human consciousness, it means instead a  world in which all levels are on the same playing field.   There can be no better example of a perfectly flat ontology than the  early philosophy of Bruno Latour. At that point in Latour\&rsquo;s career, all  human and inhuman things, all chunks of physical matter and people and  cartoon characters, are equally  actors . What makes all things  actors, despite the vast differences between them, is that they have an  effect on other things. As Latour puts it as recently as 1999 in  Pandora\&rsquo;s Hope ,  to be real means \&ldquo;to modify, transform, perturb, or create\&rdquo; something  else. Reality is defined not by what it is, but by what it does. Not  everything is equally  strong , since the Chinese government  affects more things than does a stick figure drawn in the notebook of a  Chinese schoolboy, but everything is equally  real , since even that stick figure has  some  faint emotional resonance in the boy\&rsquo;s mind and is therefore not just  an empty hole of non-being, while the mighty effect of the Chinese  government on its citizens is different only  in degree  from the  stick figure, even if that degree of difference is huge. Reality for the  early Latour means having an effect on other things. And just as for  Aristotle all humans are equally humans and all trees equally trees, for  the early Latour all actors are equally actors.   But I just finished claiming that there are objects called dormant  objects that affect nothing, not now and perhaps not ever, depending on  how things unfold. The question I want to address briefly as this essay  comes to a conclusion is whether the reverse is also true: are there  things that have an effect despite not being real? And here is where I  have been in disagreement with another philosopher friend, Levi Bryant  of the Larval Subjects blog.10 For Bryant, anything that has an effect of any sort is real, and given  that Chinese stick figures, Popeye, and the monsters of H.P. Lovecraft  all have some greater or lesser effect on someone\&rsquo;s moods or the sales  of some cinema or bookstore, all are real as well. This apparent reality  of all fictional characters has led some to accuse Bryant of defending  an absurdly inflationary universe, in which all actual and possible  things are real.   For Bryant and the early Latour, then, reality and efficacy are  interchangeable terms. And given that lots of different things can have  an effect, this seems to balloon the scope of reality to an absurd  degree. What I want to suggest here is that just as not all real things  have an effect (at least not in any given moment), not all effective  things are real. Unlike Bryant and the early Latour, this puts me  automatically  in the good graces of Ockham\&rsquo;s Razor, given that I can multiply merely  sensual  objects as much as I please and let them have as many effects as  possible without ever saying that they are \&ldquo;real,\&rdquo; that they have  autonomous existence outside their presence in the experience of some  other entity. Stated differently, I do not advocate a purely flat  ontology. Certainly I would agree with Bryant and DeLanda that there are  real entities at all levels of scale; I am completely in accord with  their anti-reductionist platform. But I do not agree further with Bryant  that just because something in the mind is having an effect on me, that  it is therefore real.   At first this might seem to place me in the same camp as what might  be called the epistemological wing of speculative realism. For such  people it is ridiculous to think that entities such as Popeye are real,  and equally ridiculous to believe in many other things experienced by  everyday common sense. Their goal is to destroy what they call the  \&ldquo;manifest image\&rdquo; in favor of the true scientific image of things.  Epistemology here means a way to debunk gullible Christians, alchemists,  and Latourians, and make the world safe for science. In their darkly  clouded eyes, while Bryant wants to say that all images are real, they  want to insist that some are real and some are false. However, I have  nothing to do with this position, for the simple reason that I think  all images are false .  And this is what makes my position more in keeping with Ockham\&rsquo;s Razor,  since it is only this position that never confuses the sensual with the  real, while the epistemological wing of speculative realism grants  reality to countless objects that are really nothing more than images,  even if we agree to call them \&ldquo;scientific\&rdquo; ones. For me nothing sensual  is ever real, no matter how many effects it might have.   Here is another way to put it. We can talk about the sensual trees,  chairs, cartoon characters, and hallucinated unicorns that might  populate human experience. The question is sometimes asked how we know  which of these sensual objects correspond to things in the real world  and which do not; \&ldquo;criteria\&rdquo; are then demanded for sorting the wheat  from the chaff, so that we might praise our images of quarks as truly  corresponding to something real while ridiculing or exterminating our  manifest folk images of Popeye and unicorns. Yet the problem must be  reframed. None of our images \&ldquo;correspond\&rdquo; to anything at all; none of  them bear any isomorphic resemblance to the real objects that withdraw  into darkness. All are fictions. Or to put it in Latourian terms, all  are  translations . We can see this by considering that no matter how excellent our scientific concept of a tree may be, this concept  is not itself a tree :  the concept of the tree may grow every summer just as a tree does, but  it neither sheds leaves nor bears fruit. Whenever I raise this  complaint, it is objected that it is a \&ldquo;straw man,\&rdquo; since no one really  believes that a real tree and its image are the same thing. In response I  say that  of course  no says this, because it is too ridiculous to maintain for an instant. Nonetheless, this ridiculous doctrine is directly  entailed  by the theory that the image of Popeye does not correspond to anything  but the image of a tree does correspond. All they might be able to add  is that while the image of a tree is simply a form or structure, the  real tree is that same form or structure stamped in physical matter. But  this would give us nothing but a dubious traditional metaphysics of  form and matter, its banality barely concealed by the table-pounding  aggressions of hack scientism.   The truth, I believe, is that  no  sensual objects \&ldquo;correspond\&rdquo;  to real ones, just as no translations of Shakespeare into French or  Dutch \&ldquo;correspond\&rdquo; to the English text. Not all translations are equal\&ndash;  there are better and worse translations of Shakespeare, just as there  are better and worse meals with which to catch the flavor of certain  wines, and better and worse ways (in Latour\&rsquo;s best example) to refine  crude oil into gasoline for your car\&rsquo;s tank, which by no means implies  that the gasoline is a \&ldquo;copy\&rdquo; of the crude oil. This is not relativism,  but rather the most hardcore possible  realism . It is not  relativism, because there really are better and worse translations; it  is hardcore realism because it takes real objects so seriously that it  holds them to be irreplaceable by any conceptual model\&mdash;no model of a  banana or apple, however detailed, can step into the world and become a  banana or apple.   In short, I join Bryant wholeheartedly in rejecting this  cop\&rsquo;s-fantasy epistemological project of distinguishing between bad  commonsense images and good scientific ones, which would reduce the  greatness of philosophy to a series of small-time drug busts. But that  said, what about Bryant\&rsquo;s further claim that fictions are real? As I see  it, the problem needs to be reframed. Granted that all real objects can  be converted into translations, the question is this: when can  translations retroactively affect the real? It cannot be denied that  this happens regularly. Our sensual experience of a room may displease  us, and this leads us to rearrange the furniture, thereby causing shifts  among real objects. The insufficient sweetness of strawberries may lead  to genetic work that alters those very strawberries. A fictional  character can provoke genuine suicides, as famously happened with  Goethe\&rsquo;s  The Sorrows of Young Werther . Some loose political ideas  in the heads of a dozen Egyptian protestors might turn into a real  Constitution that affects millions of people for generations. Even an  object with as flimsy a claim to reality as Popeye or unicorns can have  retroactive effects on the real by making huge contributions to the toy  and video game industries.   From considering the  eidos  in Husserl\&rsquo;s phenomenology, the  strange fact emerged that sensual objects always have real qualities.  Simply by dreaming up any random monster, we have not automatically  generated a real object, but we  have  generated real qualities.  Why real qualities? Because even though no unicorn or dragon is  automatically real just because it is in my mind and affects my moods,  it does automatically have real  qualities . We can never say exactly what the crucial features are of the fictions in my mind that make up the  eidos  of any one of them; those features are withdrawn from direct access and  exceed any possible analysis or interpretation of them. And that is  what makes them real, even though they belong to an unreal thing\&mdash;a mere  sensual object. The question is under what conditions the real qualities  of an unreal thing can be split up and rearranged into real objects, so  that in this way the fictional objects of our mind can cross the bridge  toward the real. As I have said, it happens all the time, and at other  times it fails. It is merely the way in which it happens or fails to  happen that remains a puzzle.   \&nbsp;  NOTES   1 Quentin Meillassoux,  After Finitude: Essay on the Necessity of Contingency , trans. R.

Activated by the appropriate receiver, they transmit information ranging from product information such as manufacturing date, delivery route, and location where the item was purchased to (in the case of credit cards) the name, address, and credit history of the person holding the card. Active RFIDs have the capacity to transmit data without having to be activated by a receiver; they can be linked with embedded sensors to allow continuous monitoring of environmental conditions, applications that interest both environmental groups and the US military. The amount of information accessible through and generated by RFIDs is so huge that it may well overwhelm all existing data sources and become, from the viewpoint of human time limitations, essentially infinite. What to make of these technologies will be interrogated through two contemporary fictions, David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas and Philip K. Dick's Ubik . Cloud Atlas focuses on epistemological questions -- who knows what about whom, in a futuristic society where all citizens wear embedded RFID tags and are subject to constant surveillance. Resistance takes the form not so much of evasion (tactical moves in a complex political Situation) but rather as a struggle to transmit information to present and future stakeholders in a world on the brink of catastrophe. Ubik, by contrast, focuses on deeper ontological questions about the nature of reality itself. Both texts point to the necessity to reconceptualize information as ethical action embedded in contexts and not merely as a quantitative measure of probabilities.},

They camped wherever, jumped on ferries and trains, and if security agents got in their way, they marched hundreds of kilometres to the next national border and protested over their right to proceed. Although migrant resistance is often practised individually, it is nevertheless embedded in the social networks of transit migration, drawing on the wisdom and collective knowledge of diasporic border-crossing communities, which Asef Bayat describes as ‘nonmovement’. In international border studies, the relationship between migration and the border is often understood in a way in which migrants as a social group, movement, or network have practically no agency at all. In this way, researchers contribute to the epistemological reproduction of the structural dominance of migration control devices.},

In exploring these questions, this article posits Indigenous data sovereignty and traditional diplomatic protocols as a means of strengthening cartographic and geographic research in collaboration with Indigenous communities and argues that integrating these principles into such research is necessary in work that strives towards decolonization.},

This paper is an ethnographic case study that provides critical reflections on the strategies employed by IXeM that respond to particular constraints and opportunities pertaining to labor and cost, including operations, acquisition of equipment, funding, and collaborative initiatives for community engagement. This case study will posit labor and cost solutions against a background of scarce resources as well as forge new ideas for community-engaged and justice-based recuperation methods in academia. In particular, this paper reflects on the way IXeM expresses the idea of digital rasquachismo to dismantle traditional archival practices that reinforce oppressive systems that disproportionately subject Brown and Black bodies to generational inequities and inspire alternative methods that retool digital technologies to center the lived experiences and wellbeing of those at the margins.  Blurring the divide between choice and necessity, IXeM is driven by both a socioeconomic imperative and a deliberate choice to challenge the authority of top-down knowledge systems by retooling commercial content sharing platforms as archival databases (see: @veteranas\_and\_rucas, @blvckvrchives, @latinx\_diaspora\_archives, @quinceaneraarchives, LA Freewaves), which some scholars have viewed as revolting and others an avenue of revolt. Going beyond just “making do,” IXeM enacts a radical politics of resistance by grabbing hold of the tools of social media to transform cultural memory work.},

  abstract = {Annotation Plantation Jamaica analyses the important but neglected role of the attorneys who managed estates, chiefly for absentee proprietors, and assesses their efficiency and impact on Jamaica during slavery and freedom. Meticulous research based on a variety of sources, including the attorney's letters, plantation papers and slave registration records, provides rich quantitative and literary data describing the attorney's role, status, range of activities and demographic characteristics. Higman charts both the extent of absentee ownership and the complex structure of the managerial hierarchy that stretched across the Atlantic. Detailed case studies compare the attorney Simon Taylor's management of Golden Grove Estate in the decade before the American Revolution and Isaac Jackson's control of Montpelier in the years immediately following the abolition of slavery. These examples provide a wealth of information about plantation life and labour, technology, trade, investments and profits. Higman also makes a unique contribution by investigating and describing several topics previously neglected, including the postal service, the history of accounting and the role of attorneys in the British Isles. The writing style is clear, persuasive and elegant, which makes the work accessible to Atlantic and Caribbean historians and to general readers as well. This book is critical in the ongoing historiographical debate about the impact of absenteeism in Jamaica, Great Britain's largest sugar-exporting colony. The sophisticated economic and social analysis reveals how managers, overseers and owners constructed an efficient value system, which permitted ethical behaviour among themselves yet perpetuated the brutal exploitation of plantation workers, enslaved and free},

The thingly relations of things include object relations; materials provide affordances or potentialities to humans. The brute matter of things has effects on us that go beyond social networks. We cannot reduce things solely to the relational, to a semiotics of things. To do so undermines the power of things to entrap, and particularly to trap the more vulnerable. In the modern world, we have come to see that we need to use things sustainably and responsibly, to care for things. But this care and sustainability themselves too frequently involve further management and control of animals, plants, landscapes, resources, and humans. A long-term archaeological perspective shows that our attempts to fix things by finding technological solutions have led to an exponential increase in material entanglements. It is in our nature as a species to try and fix our problems now by fiddling and fixing, but such responses may have their limits.},

These alterations reveal connections between parts of the poem that might otherwise easily escape notice, allow us to probe the relationship between readers and the text, and tease out some of the larger cultural significance of weather and climate in the poem.},

This book brings together a select group of internationally renowned human geographers to explore the use of these concepts in relation to space, place and territory. In doing so, they (re)situate the subject of borders as active socio-spatial processes from a variety of theoretical perspectives. The contributors link debates on borders to discussions within the wider sphere of cultural studies, notably those addressing themes of migration, post-colonialism, the formation of national/regional identities and radical democratic practice.  The chapters focus on those discursive practices that constitute 'bordered' geographical entities in the first instance through differentiated regimes of discourse. The book thus transcends the narrower field of borderlands research by building bridges to other domains of enquiry within political and human geography.},

In this paper I review the reasons as to why geographers re-discovered Marx and then, from the late 1960s, began to engage with Marxian approaches. I then consider some of the reasons why Marxian approaches in their turn became the subject of critique in geography and some of the alternatives explored in the wake of this. The conclusion is that a pluri-theoretical human geography is necessary but that Marxian approaches remain of central significance to radical and critically minded geographers.}

Here, for the first time, are all the poems that Langston Hughes published during his lifetime, arranged in the general order in which he wrote them and annotated by Arnold Rampersad and David Roessel. Alongside such famous works as "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" and Montage of a Dream Deferred, The Collected Poems includes the author's lesser-known verse for children; topical poems distributed through the Associated Negro Press; and poems such as "Goodbye Christ" that were once suppressed. Lyrical and pungent, passionate and polemical, the result is a treasure of a book, the essential collection of a poet whose words have entered our common language.},

The English drew on pre-existing European ideas about monstrosity and deformity to argue that Africans were a monstrous race, suspended between human and animal, and as such only fit for servitude. Joining blackness to disability transformed English ideas about defective bodies and minds. It also influenced understandings of race and ability even as it shaped the embodied reality of people enslaved in the British Caribbean. Stefanie Hunt-Kennedy provides a three-pronged analysis of disability in the context of Atlantic slavery. First, she examines the connections of enslavement and representations of disability and the parallel development of English anti-black racism. From there, she moves from realms of representation to reality in order to illuminate the physical, emotional, and psychological impairments inflicted by slavery and endured by the enslaved. Finally, she looks at slave law as a system of enforced disablement. Audacious and powerful, Between Fitness and Death is a groundbreaking journey into the entwined histories of racism and ableism"--},

I analyze Borda’s cartographic art project in order to illuminate the dispersal and (dis)placement of peoples in and across (virtual) urban spaces and examine how the experiences of these population distributions contribute to resistive artistic projects, and simultaneously how these art installations can reproduce settler colonial erasures, with Borda’s installation being an illustrative example. Using Borda’s text as a representative case, I advocate for the cultivation of a decolonial sensibility when engaging with digital cartography.},

  abstract = {Amidst the widespread political and social turmoil of the 1960s a number of radical groups emerged seeking not just to reform or restructure society, but to completely transform it. Amongst those agitating for a ârevolution of everyday lifeâ were the French Situationists, Dutch Provos, San Franciscoâs Diggers and a small New York based group called Black Mask who would go on to become The Family (aka Up Against The Wall Motherfucker, The Motherfuckers and UAW/MF). Having started out with a series of impromptu exhibitions in public places Black Mask announced its arrival with an action that shut down the Museum Of Modern Art (MOMA) in 1966. Always aiming to push themselves, and those around them, further toward the concept of âTotal Revolutionâ the group, through their actions and magazine Black Mask, moved their practice and critique beyond the art world in 1967 to challenge the growing counterculture and student movements. Evolving into The Family in 1968 former members of Black Mask became intimately involved in the radical politics, crash pads and street life of the Lower East Side. As âflower children with thornsâ they possessed a fiery rhetoric that took the slogan of âWe are the people our parents warned us againstâ to its logical conclusion. Citing themselves as a âstreet gang with analysisâ UAW/MF anticipated the militant swagger of the late 60s New Left whilst at the same time rejecting their peers unconditional support for authoritarians at home and abroad. This booklet was originally co-published by Homebrew Press and Active Distribution in 2007. It brings together much of the existing material created by UAW/MF as well as some pieces that help put their work and deeds in context. In the opening article historian John McMillan outlines the history of The Family and how he came to meet leading member Ben Morea whilst in an extensive interview Morea himself discusses the actions that the group took part in as well as their key ideas. Lastly and most importantly there are reprints of UAW/MFâs original writings and collages. Mixing cartoonish humour with mystical psychedelia and intense rhetoric the works reprinted here are some of the most powerful of their time. Although best experienced with their original layout and graphics intact where the quality of the originals is too poor to be fully legible they have been included as texts.},

  abstract = {Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

"The Night Women, as they call themselves, have long been plotting a slave revolt, and as Lilith comes of age and reveals the extent of her power, they see her as the key to their plans. But when she begins to understand her own feelings and desires and identity, Lilith starts to push at the edges of what is imaginable for the life of a slave woman in Jamaica, and risks becoming the conspiracy's weak link." "Lilith's story overflows with high drama and heartbreak, and life on the plantation is rife with dangerous secrets, unspoken jealousies, inhuman violence, and very human emotion - between slave and master, between slave and overseer, and among the slaves themselves. Lilith finds herself at the heart of it all."--BOOK JACKET},

Drawing on research and sources from South Asia, the paper moves instead toward more uncertain engagements with, and dispositions to, the production of geographical knowledge; ones attuned to the poetics of planetary difference. The paper speculates on five intellectual and methodological resources, or tactics, aimed toward producing geographical scholarship attuned to the tableaux of heterogeneous and incomparable singularities at large across the world: theory and reading; friction and fragments; translation/untranslatability; abiding by; and poetics.},

As previous advocates of a scalar turn, we now question the privileging, in any form, of a single dimension of sociospatial processes, scalar or otherwise. We consider several recent sophisticated ‘turns’ within critical social science; explore their methodological limitations; and highlight several important strands of sociospatial theory that seek to transcend the latter. On this basis, we argue for a more systematic recognition of polymorphy—the organization of sociospatial relations in multiple forms—within sociospatial theory. Specifically, we suggest that territories (T), places (P), scales (S), and networks (N) must be viewed as mutually constitutive and relationally intertwined dimensions of sociospatial relations. We present this proposition as an extension of recent contributions to the spatialization of the strategic-relational approach (SRA), and we explore some of its methodological implications. We conclude by briefly illustrating the applicability of the ‘TPSN framework’ to several realms of inquiry into sociospatial processes under contemporary capitalism.},

Computation provides access to information in text that we simply cannot gather using traditional qualitative methods of close reading and human synthesis. Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature provides a practical introduction to computational text analysis using the open source programming language R. R is extremely popular throughout the sciences and because of its accessibility, R is now used increasingly in other research areas. Readers begin working with text right away and each chapter works through a new technique or process such that readers gain a broad exposure to core R procedures and a basic understanding of the possibilities of computational text analysis at both the micro and macro scale. Each chapter builds on the previous as readers move from small scale 'microanalysis' of single texts to large scale 'macroanalysis' of text corpora, and each chapter concludes with a set of practice exercises that reinforce and expand upon the chapter lessons. The book's focus is on making the technical palatable and making the technical useful and immediately gratifying.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the functions, cost and influence of the state is at the heart of political geography. Having focussed on the territorial division of the earth's surface into sovereign units, and the actions taken by those groups and individuals who make decisions within the state apparatus, the author outlines how the concept of the state, its organisation and territory, came to evolve and develop. Chapters examine the state's relationships with the process of accumulation in capitalist countries, analyse the relationships between a state and its population, and describe the local state. The state derivation version of the structuralist perspective is interwoven with use of the pluralist, managerialist and instrumentalist perspectives. -J.Sheail},

According to its advocates, relational thinking challenges human geography by insisting on an open-ended, mobile, networked, and actor-centred geographic becoming. The paper discusses the importance of this `relational turn' by positioning it within the lineage of philosophical approaches to space in geography. Following this, it highlights some silences and limits, namely factors that constrain, structure, and connect space. The paper then offers a moderate relationalism by discussing the notion of `phase space'. This acknowledges relationality but insists on the confined, sometimes inertial, and always context-specific nature of geography. Some challenges for this approach are discussed.},

Katz highlights the rise of literary Yiddish in the Renaissance - widely read translations of knightly epic poems and guides for daily living - particularly by and for Jewish women. In the wake of secularizing and modernizing movements of the nineteenth century, Yiddish rose spectacularly in a few short years from a mass folk idiom to the language of sophisticated modern literature, theater, journalism, and scholarship." "From the rise of the Hasidic movement to the fiction of Isaac Bashevis Singer, from its complex relationship with the Zionist movement to its appearance on the Internet, Words on Fire argues that Yiddish represents a high point in Jewish civilization. Words on Fire is a definitive account of this remarkable language and the culture that created and sustained it."--BOOK JACKET},

I will explore the politics of producing theory that is, for example, interstitial with empirical research and social location; of scholarship that self-reflexively interpolates the theories and practices of everyday historical subjects?including, but not restricted to, scholars; and of work that reworks marginality by decomposing the major. I will discuss the ways that by consciously refusing ?mastery? in both the academy and its research practices, ?minor? research strives to change theory and practice simultaneously, and I will suggest that these practices can be conjoined with the critical and transformative concerns of Marxism, feminism, antiracism, and queer theory to pry apart conventional geographies and produce renegade cartographies of change.},

This article suggests that the methodological value of counterfactualism may be understood in terms of the three categories of common ahistorical errors that it may help to prevent: the assumptions of indispensability, causality, and inevitability. To support this claim, I survey a series of key counterfactual works and reflections on counterfactualism, arguing that the practice of counterfactualism evolved as both cause and product of an evolving popular assumption of the plasticity of history and the importance of human agency within it. For these reasons, counterfactualism is of particular importance both historically and politically. I conclude that it is time for a methodological re-assessment of the uses of such thought-experiments in history, particularly in light of counterfactualism's developmental relatedness to cultural, technological, and analytical modernity.}

  abstract = {This dissertation examines urban attitudes toward nature in the nineteenth-century, attitudes that helped shape everyday life and the metropolitan environment of the American city. This study examines the course of relations between Chicagoans, the environmental situation they encountered, and the urban environment they made. It documents the ways in which residents dealt with nature and assesses the factors that mediated the exchange. It tells stories of how the human and the non-human worlds progressed in the making of a city—from where they started to where they ended up after forty years. From 1833–1874 Chicago grew from frontier origins to the beginning of full-blown industrial urbanism. During the passage Chicagoans worked out the formulas to maintain a viable city within the regional environmental parameters. These formulas without doubt exploited, but also included sensibilities that embraced and respected the natural world. As the city matured, so too did its attitudes toward nature. By 1874 a distinctive urban environmental ethos was emerging in Chicago. The central contention of this dissertation is that this ethos involved a range of perspectives, perspectives that expressed themselves in complex and contradictory ways. Chicago's famous Union Stockyards and park system stand at opposite but representative ends of the spectrum. In the end these perspectives and expressions added up to a new kind of urban sensibility toward nature. This dissertation exposes the roots of this sensibility and traces its growth, seeking to understand the ways in which residents came to their decisions in dealing with nature, to unearth the mechanics behind them, and to set them in a story of people creating a new type of urban environment. As Chicagoans grappled with the problems of city building, they came to unique and creative understandings of the interplay between the natural and the urban. By 1874, they had defined and refined nature's roles in city life and the city's role in nature, and in the process developed a distinctive nature-based ethos stated in a style all their own.},

  abstract = {Taking as self-evident that the “dark side” under discussion is a discursive construct of the digital humanities rather than “actually existing projects” (a clarifying phrase taken from Rita Raley’s post-mla comments), this essay suggests that the construct is too often indulged at the expense of dedicated critiques of digital humanities’ projects, as well as its papers, publications, syllabi, and so forth. We inhabit the construct when we forego these normative products of academic labor in favor of the terrible things in the title of this article, things that are said nearly daily on blogs, lists, and Twitter: Digital humanities is a nest of big data ideologues. Like Johnny, digital humanities won’t read. Digital humanities doesn’t do theory. Digital humanities never historicizes. Digital humanities doesn’t do race, class, gender, or, for that matter, culture. Digital humanities is complicit. Digital humanities is a neoliberalist contrivance for dismantling the professoriate. Digital humanities is the academic import of Silicon Valley solutionism. Perhaps most damning of all: digital humanities is something separate from the rest of the humanities, and—this is the real secret—digital humanities wants it that way. Yet the zero-sum agon of the construct seems itself complicit in a worldview that is neoliberal, ahistorical, and unconcerned with the materialities of contemporary scholarly production. Sometimes, and not incidentally, the construct can even resemble the virtualized Kung Fu arena of the Matrix that was called by the same name. This essay, the third of what has become an unplanned trilogy, explains why.},

Critical data studies endeavours to answer such questions.  This paper sets out a vision for critical data studies, building on the initial provocations of Dalton and Thatcher (2014).  It is divided into three sections.  The first details the recent step change in the production and employment of data and how data and databases are being reconceptualised.  The second forwards the notion of a data assemblage that encompasses all of the technological, political, social and economic apparatuses and elements that constitutes and frames the generation, circulation and deployment of data.  Drawing on the ideas of Michel Foucault and Ian Hacking it is posited that one way to enact critical data studies is to chart and unpack data assemblages.  The third starts to unpack some the ways that data assemblages do work in the world with respect to dataveillance and the erosion of privacy, profiling and social sorting, anticipatory governance, and secondary uses and control creep.  The paper concludes by arguing for greater conceptual work and empirical research to underpin and flesh out critical data studies.},

  abstract = {In recent years, scholars from across the humanities, including literary critics Stephen Best and Saidiya Hartman, have theorized about how best to account for the silences endemic to the archive of American slavery. These critics call for a shift away from what Best has described as a “logic and ethic of recovery” to a new focus, instead, on animating the mysteries of the past. With the example of James Hemings, Thomas Jefferson’s enslaved chef (and Sally Hemings’s older brother), this essay shows how a set of techniques associated with the digital humanities—in particular, techniques that derive from the fields of computational linguistics and data visualization—can further illuminate these mysteries. It also describes how the unique demands of the archive of slavery pose challenges to the field of digital humanities as it is currently conceived. By contrasting a set of visualizations of Hemings’s archival trace with Jefferson’s own charts and tables, Klein demonstrates how we must rethink the empiricist epistemology of the visible that endures to this day. After a brief discussion of data visualization as it relates to the construction of race, Klein turns to the issue of labor, and concludes that Hemings’s culinary labor, when considered as techne, can inform discussions of digital labor today.},

We acknowledge that the use of both types of data has been possible in GIS for some time, particularly for representation purposes. However, a recursive integration of different forms of data at the analysis level has been less explored and minimally theorized. Drawing on recent work in critical GIS and feminist perspectives, we suggest that visualization offers a strong technique for this effort but we approach it from the analytical base of grounded theory. Thus, we present an example of how grounded theory and visualization might be used together to construct an integrated analysis strategy that is both iterative and reflexive, both contextual and conceptual. We use Knigge's work on community gardens in Buffalo, New York, to provide a substantive example of the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Despite considerable progress in recent geographic information systems (GIS) research (especially on public-participation GIS), the critical discourse on GIS in the 1990s does not seem to have affected GIS practices in geographic research in significant ways. Development in critical GIS practice has been quite limited to date, and GIS and critical geographies remain two separate, if not overtly antagonistic, worlds. This suggests that critical engagement that seeks to conceive and materialize the critical potential of GIS for geographic research is still sorely needed. In this article, I explore the possibilities for this kind of critical engagement through revisiting some of the central arguments in the critical discourse from feminist perspectives. I examine whether GIS methods are inherently incompatible with feminist epistemologies through interrogating their connection with positivist scientific practices and visualization technologies. Bearing in mind the limitations of current GIS, I explore several ways in which GIS methods may be used to enrich feminist geographic research. I propose to reimagine GIS as a method in feminist geography and describe feminist visualization as a possible critical practice in feminist research. I argue that GIS can be re-envisioned and used in feminist geography in ways that are congenial to feminist epistemologies and politics. These alternative practices represent a new kind of critical engagement with GIS that is grounded on the critical agency of the GIS user/researcher.},

The adoption of the Internet as a platform for PGIS applications therefore raises concerns about the future of PGIS projects. While the Internet may open the participatory process, it can also hinder participation among local groups. In an era when PGIS applications have become important in the management of local resources, there is an urgent need to examine implications of the On-line PGIS project. Accordingly, in this paper, we assess the potential benefits and drawbacks of on-line PGIS applications within local communities.},

This source is recognized here—both semiotically and then ontologically—as a “metaphorphic zone.” It is just such a common articulation that could allow speaking with and about former “facts of nature” in a different way, a way better adjusted to the new political situation.},

  abstract = {Jeremy Wood, places, code and GPS are the protagonists in his personal cartographies. He plots the journeys, bicycles, boats, planes and his two feet provide him mobility, and geography is the precept, all of which are mediated by the communication infrastructure. Land, water, air and the engineered environment of places determine the routes, are the medium within which his body moves and are the settings where he performs his traces. Time, location and established measurement standards, along with geodetic models, radio signals, software, the language of culture and place, encode the narrative voice. GPS is his cartographic rendering tool: it is what points, traces, locates and recounts. Cartography is his narrative mode: it is that which conveys his personal narrative. This article is about a series of conversations mediated by telephone, Skype, email and online chat functions. We discussed Wood's personal cartographies, how these journeys tell him where he is, has been and potentially where he is going. These are personal cartographies, the result of individual journeys that he is assembling. His GPS tracings make us privy to his personal data, which tell us something about him while questions about science, cartography and technology also become conspicuous. The focus is on the Data Cloud outdoor installation, the Meridian performance and Lawn Mowing experiments. Wood's work is playful, yet it also critically foregrounds the fallacy of technological accuracy and the imprecision of stories. Where he is and where things are positioned are inaccurate from a GPS point of view, since GPS is engineered imprecision. This lack of specificity changes the location of things in space ever so slightly, but just enough to confound physical reality as we see in the Data Clouds outdoor installation. However, are stories ever definitive accounts of an experience? And what of the models by which we understand the world? What if we are between spatial models and some spaces are nowhere to be seen? Does that mean the place does not exist? What does it mean to be there but lost in space? What does it mean for a place to exist in the first place? His Meridian performance of the Herman Melville quote 'It is not down in any map; true places never are' elucidates this special conundrum in both literal and metaphorical terms. He traces the words along two meridians drawn according to two different but scientifically approved mathematical models of the earth, GMT and GRS80. Ironically, true places are written in Greenwich Park, the very same location where time and space were established as a standard in 1884.},

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the power of social science and its methods. We first argue that social inquiry and its methods are productive: they (help to) make social realities and social worlds. They do not simply describe the world as it is, but also enact it. Second, we suggest that, if social investigation makes worlds, then it can, in some measure, think about the worlds it wants to help to make. It gets involved in ‘ontological politics’. We then go on to show that its methods - and its politics - are still stuck in, and tend to reproduce, nineteenth-century, nation-state-based politics. How might we move social science from the enactment of nineteenth-century realities? We argue that social-and-physical changes in the world are - and need to be - paralleled by changes in the methods of social inquiry. The social sciences need to re-imagine themselves, their methods, and their ‘worlds’ if they are to work productively in the twenty-first century where social relations appear increasingly complex, elusive, ephemeral, and unpredictable. There are various possibilities: perhaps, for instance, there is need for ‘messy’ methods. But in the present paper we explore some implications of complexity theory to see whether and how this might provide productive metaphors and theories for enacting twenty-first-century realities.},

  abstract = {How do marginalized ethnic communities assert their presence in the American urban space? This article examines maps and location descriptions found in ‘Rock Angelino’ concert flyers, lyrics of songs, and spoken word multimedia pieces as examples of ‘mapping from below’ practices from the 1990s to the near present, which Latinxs have used to place themselves in the historical geography and cultural imaginary of Los Angeles. While people of Latin American descent have been part of Los Angeles since its founding, their presence has often been neglected and diminished in the maps created by government agencies, and in more recent times, by gentrifying real estate enterprises that inaccurately portray the past and present of Los Angeles as a White space with few selective geographical locations of communities of colour. By employing critical geography and cultural history methodologies, this piece demonstrates how Latinxs have been cartographers of their own communities. Most significantly how Latinxs employed their words and sounds as mapping tools with which to chart, examine, narrate and make visible the rich layered histories of Latinxs and communities of colour in Southern California.},

Written at the birth of post-war consumerism, the Critique was a philosophical inspiration for the 1968 student revolution in France and is considered to be the founding text of all that we know as cultural studies, as well as a major influence on the fields of contemporary philosophy, geography, sociology, architecture, political theory and urbanism. A work of enormous range and subtlety, Lefebvre takes as his starting-point and guide the “trivial” details of quotidian experience: an experience colonized by the commodity, shadowed by inauthenticity, yet one which remains the only source of resistance and change.This is an enduringly radical text, untimely today only in its intransigence and optimism.},

In the analysis of rhythms -- both biological and social -- Lefebvre shows the interrelation of space and time in the understanding of everyday life.With dazzling skills, Lefebvre moves between discussions of music, the commodity, measurement, the media and the city. In doing so he shows how a non-linear conception of time and history balanced his famous rethinking of the question of space. This volume also includes his earlier essays on "The Rhythmanalysis Project" and "Attempt at the Rhythmanalysis of Mediterranean Towns."},

  abstract = {Whilst greatly valuing recent critiques of the vertical imaginary and reified ontology of scale theory, and of the unfettered flows of network theory, this paper argues against a human geography without scale. Rather, four propositions from the theoretical literature are used to provide a tool-kit to analyse the practical negotiation of scalar politics, namely that: scales should be considered as effects, not frames or structures, of practice; networks must be considered in all their complexity and heterogeneity; networks can be interpreted as assemblages, the more re-territorialising and re-scaling of which can be analysed as apparatuses; and that state apparatuses work to create the impression that scales are ahistorical, hierarchical and possess exclusive relationships. These propositions are used to explore a period of history when the scalar constitution of the world was under intense debate. The interwar era saw the imperial scale clash with that of the international, both as ideological worldviews, and as a series of interacting institutions. The assemblages of internationalism and imperialism were embodied by apparatuses such as the League of Nations and the colonial Government of India respectively. Attempts by the League to encourage the abolition of tolerated brothels in an attempt to reduce the trafficking of women and children led to intense debates between the 1920s and 1930s over what constituted the legitimate domains of the international and the ‘domestic’. These explicitly scalar debates were the product of League networks that threatened the scalar sovereignty of the Raj, most directly through the travelling Commission of Enquiry into Traffic in Women and Children in the East in 1931.

  abstract = {This intervention advances glitches as epistemological vectors for apprehending and engaging the significance of digitally-mediated spatialities that appear nonperformative against normative scripts of urban computational paradigms. Drawing on two strands of contemporary thinking about glitches as systemic design features of digital systems and as generative fissures within them, we mobilize a queer orientation that stays with the generative tensions of urban spatialities that present as idiosyncratic and as interrupting. We mobilize this epistemological approach through illustrative U.S. based examples of seemingly abandoned shared e-bikes, performatively ?ugly? homes, and wilful property dilapidation wrought through the registers of desire and aesthetics. In so doing, we show how glitch empistemologies render visible how the technocapitalist manufacturing of normative spatial desires for particular kinds of urban sociospatialities and aesthetic visual signatures are both secured and interrupted on digitally-mediated and -mediatized terrains. Glitch epistemologies establish the significance of small-scale disorientations in digital urban mediations, engaging these nonperformativities and non-computes as unexceptional openings onto everyday possibilities for politics in computational cities.},

  abstract = {?Platform urbanism? has recently gained traction as a designator for emergent dynamics and material configurations associated with the increasing presence of digital platform enterprises in cities. Initial scholarly engagements with platform urbanism have tended to coalesce around critiques of digital platforms as progenitors of inevitably dystopian urban futures. In this paper, I advance a counter-topographical minor theory of platform urbanism. I do so by drawing on Legacy Russell's notion of the glitch as a tendency toward both error and erratum (correction) in digital systems, mobilizing space/times where platforms appear ?glitchy??unexpectedly, otherwise than anticipated, or not at all?as the margins of platform urbanism. Through the narration of three specific platform/city interfaces from the minors of their glitchy margins, I capture the ways in which platform?urban configurations are demonstrably open to negotiations, reconfigurations, and diffractions through tactical maneuvers rooted in everyday digital practices of urban denizens. Theorized from the minor, platform urbanism is a phenomenon that may beget an array of possible outcomes that remain shapeable by mundane tactical interventions in the platform-mediated present. This ultimately underwrites possibilities for more hopeful digital urban politics, theory, and futures.},

Internal to poststructuralism, this metaphysics collapses the traditional separation between ontology and epistemology, reducing ontological questions to epistemological constructs. Although critiques have moved beyond an initial fixation upon positivism, critical/cultural assessments of GIS tendered within the last ten years continue to motivate epistemology as a basis for its deconstruction. The epistemological reductionism of such a reading of the technology inappropriately abstracts GIS from its ontic basis in computing, giving rise to a fundamental ‘disconnect’ of poststructuralist metaphysics to the technology. This disconnect is identified in terms of (1) the epistemic fallacy, which, underwritten by (2) an ‘undoing’ of the metaphysics of presence, culminates in (3) an effective ‘deontologization’ of an immediately ontic entity. This does not negate the poststructuralist critique of GIS, but it necessitates that critical engagements of the technology accord a material ontological ground to the objects of critique.},

Drawing upon evidence of state, market, and citizen practices around Web-based spatial media and geoinformation, I argue that as the state is ?rolling back? from public aspects of the cartographic project, market regimes of governance are simultaneously ?rolling out?, subsuming the mapping enterprise to the imperatives of technoscientific capitalism.},

Caroline Levine argues that forms organize not only works of art but also political life--and our attempts to know both art and politics. Inescapable and frequently troubling, forms shape every aspect of our experience. But forms don't impose their order in any simple way. Multiple shapes, patterns, and arrangements, overlapping and colliding, generate complex and unpredictable social landscapes that challenge and unsettle conventional analytic models in literary and cultural studies. Borrowing the concept of "affordances" from design theory, this book investigates the specific ways that four major forms--wholes, rhythms, hierarchies, and networks--have structured culture, politics, and scholarly knowledge across periods, and it proposes exciting new ways of linking formalism to historicism and literature to politics. Levine rereads both formalist and antiformalist theorists, including Cleanth Brooks, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Mary Poovey, and Judith Butler, and she offers engaging accounts of a wide range of objects, from medieval convents and modern theme parks to Sophocles's Antigone and the television series The Wire. The result is a radically new way of thinking about form for the next generation and essential reading for scholars and students across the humanities who must wrestle with the problem of form and context"--},

  abstract = {The emergence and proliferation of neogeographic practices since the mid-2000s have drawn significant attention from GIS scholars. I seek to contribute to the discussion on situating neogeography, particularly through examining the performative dimension of neogeography. To understand performative neogeographic practices I enroll de Certeau's notion of tactics to read these practices as tactical spatial narratives, which may provide different possibilities for spaces of civic engagement and political intervention in an increasingly networked and yet individualized society. I also draw upon theoretical insights from critical GIS and critical social theory to situate and trace the constructions of performative neogeographic practices within particular sociopolitical contexts. Through this synthesized framework, I discuss a case study involved in a participatory art performance project entitled ?Everyone's East Lake? in China. Drawing upon interviews and document analysis, the author examines how participants utilize neogeographic mapping as a form of performance and tactical act in response to the dominant corporate and state power. While performative mapping has long been used by artists and cartographers, this case study illustrates how these performative neogeographic practices might highlight different intersections between self-identities, community participation, and sociopolitical conditions, through reconfigurations of mobile and networked mapping technologies. These dynamic, hybrid, and networked mapping practices necessitate a broader conceptualization of activism through mapping in critical GIS research.},

In this paper, I argue that the charge of ‘reification’ has been accepted too readily, masking areas of conceptual overlap between political-economic and poststructural approaches, particularly in terms of their shared concern with the construction of scale. On this basis, I propose to replace the established concept of ‘the politics of scale’ with ‘scalar politics’, arguing that it is often not scale per se that is the prime object of contention, but rather specific processes and institutionalized practices that are themselves differentially scaled.},

Hakluyt's Promise demonstrates his prominent role in the establishment of English America as well as his interests in English opportunities in the East Indies. The volume presents nearly fifty illustrations - many unpublished since the sixteenth century - and offers a fresh view of Hakluyt's milieu and the central concerns of the Elizabethan age." "Though he never traveled farther than Paris, young Hakluyt spent much of the 1580s recording information about the western hemisphere and became an international authority on overseas exploration. The book traces his rise to prominence as a source of information and inspiration for England's policy makers, including the queen, and his advocacy for colonies in Roanoke and Jamestown. Hakluyt's thought was shaped by debates that stretched across Europe, and his interests ranged just as widely, encompassing such topics as peaceful coexistence with Native Americans, the New World as a Protestant Holy Land, and, in his later life, trade with the Spice Islands."--BOOK JACKET},

Reading the~Grundrisse's famous comments on the annihilation of space by time, I trace the Hegelian roots of these concepts to show that for both Marx ahd Hegel, negation is the very act of critique itself, and necessity is properly understood not as the force of history, but as the object of historical explanation2013what makes things the way they are and not another. It is therefore crucial to critical geography's efforts to identify the possibilities for social change, for that analysis must be predicated on an understanding for how things have emerged in their present form, i.e. the one we have to work with. I argue that a negative geography of necessity is the essential basis for anything we might call a communist geography, a geography of "the real movement which abolishes the present state of things".}

There are other related concepts, like collage, which have been used to give these values substance in research, but currently assemblage is enjoying a popularity perhaps because of the continuing fascination of the work of Deleuze and Guattari.},

  abstract = {This essay aims to refute the influential argument, made famous by Jean Starobinski and recently restated by Michael Sandel, that Rousseau's political thought aims at transparency, in which citizens understand each other immediately, unambiguously and without distortion. Whatever transparency Rousseau fosters in the political sphere may safely be characterized as limited and more boldly as a lie. Rousseau favors the appearance of transparency because it bolsters patriotism but does not favor real transparency because it is dangerous to seek among equals and impossible to realize among unequals. Though Sandel may be right to criticize Rousseau's "unitary" republicanism, his own "pluralistic" republicanism fails even to take into account Rousseau's argument that proponents of openness conflate the conditions of philosophy and community and propose to benefit the few at the expense of the many.}

We evaluate different approaches to understanding their workings, each of which must grapple with the problem of connecting the local and the global, and contrast these to that of our recent work aimed at elaborating a 'flat ontology'. The central feature of this alternative ontology is the site: a material localization characterized by differential relations through which one site is connected to other sites, out of which emerges a social space that can be understood to extend, however unevenly and temporarily, across distant places. Yet, in light of its focus on practices - on situated sayings and doings - our ontology must refuse the spatial imaginaries that underpin nearly all discussions of globalization. To illustrate our position we examine the practices of popular filmmaking within Lagos, Nigeria (Nollywood). This site is an entry point for comprehending and enlarging upon the political implications of our ontology - one that is meant not only to rethink globalization but to unsettle the abstractions that enable its expanding hegemony.

And yet, despite the insights that both empirical and theoretical research on scale have generated, there is today no consensus on what is meant by the term or how it should be operationalized. In this paper we critique the dominant 2013 hierarchical 2013 conception of scale, arguing it presents a number of problems that cannot be overcome simply by adding on to or integrating with network theorizing. We thereby propose to eliminate scale as a concept in human geography. In its place we offer a different ontology, one that so flattens scale as to render the concept unnecessary. We conclude by addressing some of the political implications of a human geography without scale.}

Overwhelmingly, this work reflects a social constructionist approach, which situates capitalist production (and the role of the state, capital, labor and nonstate political actors) as of central concern. What is missing from this discussion about the social construction of scale is serious attention to the relevance of social reproduction and consumption. In this article I review the important literature on scale construction and argue for enlarging our scope for understanding scale to include the complex processes of social reproduction and consumption. I base my critique on a short case study which illustrates that attention to other processes besides production and other systems of domination besides capitalism can enhance our theorizing and improve our attempts to effect real social change.},

However, just as with any technology, data science has also come with some negative consequences: an increase of privacy invasion, data-driven discrimination against sensitive groups, and decision making by complex models without explanations. While data scientists and business managers are not inherently unethical, they are not trained to weigh the ethical considerations that come from their work - Data Science Ethics addresses this increasingly significant gap and highlights different concepts and techniques that aid understanding, ranging from k-anonymity and differential privacy to homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs to address privacy concerns, techniques to remove discrimination against sensitive groups, and various explainable AI techniques. Real-life cautionary tales further illustrate the importance and potential impact of data science ethics, including tales of racist bots, search censoring, government backdoors, and face recognition. The book is punctuated with structured exercises that provide hypothetical scenarios and ethical dilemmas for reflection that teach readers how to balance the ethical concerns and the utility of data. --},

It is proposed here that not only is this an inadequate model of science but that it has led us astray in our inherited conceptualizations of both time and space. The urge to think 'historically' is now evident in both physical and human geography. The paper argues that this both forms the basis for a possible conversation and also obliges us to rethink our notions of space/space-time.}

Offering powerful new ways of thinking about our cities, Code and Clay, Data and Dirt goes far beyond the standard historical concepts of origins, development, revolutions, and the accomplishments of an elite few. Mattern shows that in their architecture, laws, street layouts, and civic knowledge-and through technologies including the telephone, telegraph, radio, printing, writing, and even the human voice-cities have long negotiated a rich exchange between analog and digital, code and clay, data and dirt, ether and ore. Matterns vivid prose takes readers through a historically and geographically broad range of stories, scenes, and locations, synthesizing a new narrative for our urban spaces. Taking media archaeology to the citys streets, Code and Clay, Data and Dirt reveals new ways to write our urban, media, and cultural histories.},

We firstly over-view the current range of handling citizen’s local (spatial) knowledge in VGI by identifying two foundational drivers, which are: the recognition of the value of vulgar local knowledge, and the acceleration of cyberspace communication capacities.~ Section 2 analyses VGI modalities and systems in terms of their characteristics and practices, in a frame of good governance principles and participatory process. In Section 3 this analytical framework is used in evaluating two specific cases in terms of governance and participation principles and practice. The paper concludes with needs and challenges about shifting the boundaries of VGI towards a deeper, more participatory construct of ‘vulgar grounded intelligence’.~    [1] Without a consensus on a suitable overarching term for the set of approaches, systems, and modalities for acquiring citizens’ local (spatial) knowledge, we use the term VGI to also incorporate relevant UGC (user-generated content) systems.},

In doing so, it challenges the very notion of scholarship as it has traditionally been imagined. Incorporating scientific, socio-historical, materialist and theoretical approaches, this rich body of work explores topics ranging from how computers have affected our relationship to language, whether the book has become an obsolete object, the nature of online journalism, and the psychology of authorship. The essays offer a significant contribution to the growing debate on how digitization is shaping our collective identity, for better or worse"--Publisher's description.},

These projects depend on temporally specific lexicons and gazetteers that enable place name identification and georesolution. Scholars working on the early modern period (1400–1800) lack temporally appropriate geoparsers and gazetteers and have been reliant on general purpose linked open data services like Geonames. These anachronistic resources introduce significant information retrieval and ethical challenges for early modernists. Using the geography entries of the canonical eighteenth-century Encyclopédie, we evaluate rule-based named entity recognition (NER) systems to pinpoint areas where they would benefit from adjustments for processing historical corpora. As we demonstrate, annotating nested and extended place information is one way to improve early modern GTA. Working with Enlightenment sources also motivates a critique of the landscape of digital geospatial data.},

This journey has been planned according to an academic goal: assessing the potential of online cartography for decolonial purposes. To reach this goal, we have followed methodological directions provided by Indigenous scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith to review 18 Indigenous web-mapping sites across Canada. Supported by a series of ten interviews, this content analysis enabled us to sketch some of the contours of contemporary Indigenous cartography. On one hand, Indigenous communities largely control the data that are shared on these websites. They also partially control the way these data are represented through the mobilization of digital storytelling technologies that are better aligned with Indigenous ways of envisioning relationships to places than conventional maps. On the other hand, they do not have much control over the technological aspects of these projects, for which they remain heavily dependent on non-Indigenous partners. Throughout this journey, we noticed that women's voices remained marginal in most of these mapping projects, but we also identified evidence supporting the idea that these voices are starting to play a vital role in the on-going effort of decolonizing mapping processes.},

Building on the already extraordinary legacy of McKay’s life and work, this colorful, dramatic novel centers on the efforts by Harlem intelligentsia to organize support for the liberation of fascist-controlled Ethiopia, a crucial but largely forgotten event in American history. At once a penetrating satire of political machinations in Depression-era Harlem and a far-reaching story of global intrigue and romance, Amiable with Big Teeth plunges into the concerns, anxieties, hopes, and dreams of African-Americans at a moment of crisis for the soul of Harlem—and America. ~For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

We survey the vast terrain of "culturomics", focusing on linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. "Culturomics" extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social sciences and the humanities.},

As a staple of the tours, guides entertain paying customers by routinely relying on stories of enslaved black specters. But who are these ghosts? Examining popular sites and stories from these tours, Miles shows that haunted tales routinely appropriate and skew African American history to produce representations of slavery for commercial gain. "Dark tourism" often highlights the most sensationalist and macabre aspects of slavery, from salacious sexual ties between white masters and black women slaves to the physical abuse and torture of black bodies to the supposedly exotic nature of African spiritual practices. Because the realities of slavery are largely absent from these tours, Miles reveals how they continue to feed problematic "Old South" narratives and erase the hard truths of the Civil War era. In an incisive and engaging work, Miles uses these troubling cases to shine light on how we feel about the Civil War and race, and how the ghosts of the past are still with us"--},

  abstract = {"Damn you bastards, coming here making trouble. Bunch of animals." The two police offers responding to a call about an open fire hydrant lash out furiously at the Puerto Rican residents of New York City's El Barrio neighborhood. It's the summer of 1941, and all ten-year-old Nilda wants to do is enjoy the cool water with her friends. But the policemen's curses end their fun, and their animosity is played out over and over again in Nilda's life. She is repeatedly treated with contempt and even disgust by adults in positions of authority: teachers, nurses and social workers.At home, though, she is surrounded by a large and loving--if somewhat eccentric--family that supports and encourages her artistic abilities. She experiences the onset of World War II and watches anxiously as several brothers go off to war; her stepfather s poor health means he can t work, causing serious financial difficulties for the family; one brother slinks off to the underworld, leaving behind a pregnant girlfriend, adding two more mouths to feed to the family s already dire situation. Named an "Outstanding Book of the Year" by The New York Times and one of the "Best Books of the Year" by the American Library Association in 1973 when it was first published, Nicholasa Mohr's classic novel about life as an immigrant in New York City offers a poignant look at one young girl's experiences. Issues of race, religion and machismo are realistically and movingly depicted in this groundbreaking coming-of-age novel that was one of the first by a Latina author to be hailed by the mainstream media.},

Austin, and extended by Stanley Cavell - to transform literary studies. In engaging and lucid prose, Toril Moi demonstrates this philosophy's unique ability to lay bare the connections between words and the world, dispel the notion of literature as a monolithic concept, and teach readers how to learn from a literary text. Moi first introduces Wittgenstein's vision of language and theory, which refuses to reduce language to a matter of naming or representation, considers theory's desire for generality doomed to failure, and brings out the philosophical power of the particular case. Contrasting ordinary language philosophy with dominant strands of Saussurean and post-Saussurean thought, she highlights the former's originality, critical power, and potential for creative use. Finally, she challenges the belief that good critics always read below the surface, proposing instead an innovative view of texts as expression and action, and of reading as an act of acknowledgment. Intervening in cutting-edge debates while bringing Wittgenstein, Austin, and Cavell to new readers, 'Revolution of the Ordinary' will appeal beyond literary studies to anyone looking for a philosophically serious account of why words matter.},

Our project involves building a platform capable of retrieving, mapping and analyzing the occurrences of named urban roads in novels in which the action occurs wholly or partly in Paris. This platform will be used in several areas, such as cultural tourism, urban research, and literary analysis. The paper focuses on extracting named urban roads and mapping the results for a sample of 31 novels published between 1800 and 1914. Two approaches to the annotation of odonyms are compared. First, we describe a proof of concept using queries made via the TXM textual analysis platform. Then, we describe an automatic process using a natural language processing (NLP) method. Additionally, we mention how the geosemantic information annotated from the text (e.g., a structure combining verbs, spatial relations, named entities, adjectives and adverbs) can be used to automatically characterize the semantic content associated with named urban roads.},

Yet attendant with this move has been a growing concern that scale has become an unwieldy concept laden with multiple, contradictory and problematic meanings. I share that concern, and argue that a similar debate about the usefulness of `identity' as a conceptual category in social science offers instructive insights. Paralleling recent critiques of identity categories such as nation and race, I view the conceptual confusion surrounding scale — and scale politics — as, in part, the consequence of failing to make a clear distinction between scale as a category of practice and category of analysis. In adopting scale as a category of analysis geographers tend to reify it as a fundamental ontological entity, thereby treating a social category employed in the practice of sociospatial politics as a central theoretical tool. I argue that this analytical manoeuvre is neither helpful nor necessary, and outline its consequences in analyses of the politics of scale. Finally, I sketch the altered contours of a research programme for the politics of scale if we take this injunction seriously — both in terms of how we theorize scale as a category of practice and what becomes the focus of scale politics research.},

The first section argues for the value of Kuhn’s concept of paradigm shifts as a tool for examining changes in research fields such as social science research methodology. The next two sections consider the initial rise of the “metaphysical paradigm” that justified the renewed interest in qualitative research and the subsequent problems that have encouraged efforts to replace that paradigm. The final section of the paper advocates a “pragmatic approach” as a new guiding paradigm in social science research methods, both as a basis for supporting work that combines qualitative and quantitative methods and as a way to redirect our attention to methodological rather than metaphysical concerns.},

Through a study of numeracy, trade, counting, and commerce, the lives and experiences of enslaved women in the sixteenth and seventeenth century English Atlantic world come into focus. Rather than treating economy and culture as distinct aspects of social history, Reckoning with Slavery asks what we can come to know about kinship, family, and race through the archives of trade and commerce"--},

  abstract = {In Ecology without Nature, Timothy Morton argues that the chief stumbling block to environmental thinking is the image of nature itself. Ecological writers propose a new worldview, but their very zeal to preserve the natural world leads them away from the "nature" they revere. The problem is a symptom of the ecological catastrophe in which we are living. Morton sets out a seeming paradox: to have a properly ecological view, we must relinquish the idea of nature once and for all.Ecology without Nature investigates our ecological assumptions in a way that is provocative and deeply engaging. Ranging widely in eighteenth-century through contemporary philosophy, culture, and history, he explores the value of art in imagining environmental projects for the future. Morton develops a fresh vocabulary for reading "environmentality" in artistic form as well as content, and traces the contexts of ecological constructs through the history of capitalism. From John Clare to John Cage, from Kierkegaard to Kristeva, from The Lord of the Rings to electronic life forms, Ecology without Nature widens our view of ecological criticism, and deepens our understanding of ecology itself. Instead of trying to use an idea of nature to heal what society has damaged, Morton sets out a radical new form of ecological criticism: "dark ecology."},

Its importance derives mainly from the multivariate central limit theorem. The multivariate normal distribution is often used to describe, at least approximately, any set of (possibly) correlated real-valued random variables, each of which clusters around a mean value.},

Matthew W. Wilson draws together archival research on the birth of the digital map with a reconsideration of the critical turn in mapping and cartographic thought. Seeking to bridge a foundational divide within the discipline of geography--between cultural and human geographers and practitioners of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)--Wilson suggests that GIS practitioners may operate within a critical vacuum and may not fully contend with their placement within broader networks, the politics of mapping, the rise of the digital humanities, the activist possibilities of appropriating GIS technologies, and more. Employing the concept of the drawn and traced line, Wilson treads the theoretical terrain of Deleuze, Guattari, and Gunnar Olsson while grounding their thoughts with the hybrid impulse of the more-than-human thought of Donna Haraway. What results is a series of interventions--fractures in the lines directing everyday life--that provide the reader with an opportunity to consider the renewed urgency of forceful geographic representation. These five fractures are criticality, digitality, movement, attention, and quantification. New Lines examines their traces to find their potential and their necessity in the face of our frenetic digital life"--},

This model is also known as the newsvendor problem or newsboy problem by analogy with the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must decide how many copies of the day's paper to stock in the face of uncertain demand and knowing that unsold copies will be worthless at the end of the day.},

The principal argument of the paper is that networks forged in particular places and at great distances play distinctive yet complementary functions in broad-based social movements. Not only does the articulation of these different types of networks result in complementary roles, but it also introduces key relational dynamics affecting the stability of the entire social movement. The purpose of the paper is therefore threefold: to provide a conceptual framework for interpreting the complex geographies of contemporary social movement networks, to stress the contributions of place-based relations in social movements and to assess how activist places connect to form 'social movement space'.}

  abstract = {Mapping spatial information to represent indigenous knowledge (IK) and rights has been taking place since the early 1970s in various parts of Canada. These mapping initiatives continue to be primarily associated with traditional land-use (TLU) studies and have deep roots in participatory methods that include aspects of participatory geographic information systems (PGIS). In the current context of encroaching industrial developments into indigenous homelands and the strengthening of Indigenous rights within Canadian Supreme Court rulings, the role of mapping TLU information is central. Who is conducting the research, what tools are used, and how this information is shared are all key questions being asked in the Indigenous context. As a result, the quality of spatial data has become a critical part of these engagement processes. This paper focuses on the intersections of new methods of TLU/IK data collection, namely a direct-to-digital approach that seeks to minimize misrepresentation and mistranslations of IK. From these intersections, the authors recognize the need to establish Indigenous-led quality indicators that directly address the introduction of new methods into the TLU/IK field. Indigenous geographic information and spatial data quality indicators will better address the current needs of Indigenous communities in the negotiation of resource developments in their territories, and provide a new path forward for enhancing the use of geospatial technologies in Indigenous communities.},

  abstract = {Abstract:\enspace{} Territory is the quintessential state space and appears to be of growing political importance. It is also a key concept in geography, but it has not been subject to as much critical attention as related geographical terms and remains under-theorised. Taking my cue from Timothy Mitchell's suggestion that the state should be understood as the effect of social practices, I argue that the phenomenon that we call territory is not an irreducible foundation of state power, let alone the expression of a biological imperative. Instead, territory too must be interpreted principally as an effect. This “territory-effect” can best be understood as the outcome of networked socio-technical practices. Thus, far from refuting or falsifying network theories of spatiality, the current resurgence of territory can be seen as itself a product of relational networks. Drawing on an empirical case study of the monitoring of regional economic performance through the measurement of gross value added (GVA), I show that “territory” and “network” are not, as is often assumed, incommensurable and rival principles of spatial organisation, but are intimately connected.},

Slowly, in stories artfully spliced together, the lives and fortunes of five characters unfold. Mac, Janey, Eleanor, Ward, and Charley are caught on the storm track of this parallel and blown New Yorkward.

For the Abrams, very prejudiced southerners, the North is a nightmare, a freezing region, inhabited by uncouth beings, spluttering out an incomprehensible language, 'cheutimi'. Philippe goes alone.

Diana Paton moves beyond attempts to define and describe what obeah was, instead showing the political imperatives that often drove interpretations and discussions of it. She shows that representations of obeah were entangled with key moments in Caribbean history, from eighteenth-century slave rebellions to the formation of new nations after independence. Obeah was at the same time a crucial symbol of the Caribbean's alleged lack of modernity, a site of fear and anxiety, and a thoroughly modern and transnational practice of healing itself"--},

I examine the opposition between quantitative and qualitative methods as an extension of different epistemologies and not as indicative of their innate incompatibility, and reposition GIS within these methods seen as a continuum. I show that the always-assumed alignment of GIS with quantitative research has never been complete and the many openings in GIS enable qualitative research. I also discuss how critical geographers can engage with and transform GIS as well as enhance their explanations and social theory in general by representing spatially complex social processes and relationships.}

Forest mapping by government forestry planners allocates rights of resource use and land access according to forest types and economic objectives, only rarely recognizing indigenous occupancy rights or forest territories customarily claimed or managed by local people. As maps and official plans based on them ignore, and in some cases criminalize, traditional rights to forest, forest products, and forest land for temporary conversion to swidden agriculture, indigenous activists are using sketch maps to re-claim territories - a process that requires re-defining many traditional forest rights. The paper considers the political implications of mapping and the implications of a focus on land use rather than forest use.},

Although the emphasis of such creations relies on historical alteration (resulting in an alternate time stream), settings can impressively support the historical alternative: most alternate history plots come with shifted or even newly drawn political borders and are set in transformed urban and rural spaces. Not surprisingly, actual maps or at least remarkably detailed layouts of the geographical framework play a significant role. In other words, counterfactual spaces can be mapped with words or cartographic symbols; they can be both told and visualized. By including both concepts from the field of theory of the narrative and from a cartographer's point of view, focus is laid on various strategies in order to map and/or remap cities, countries, as well as entire geopolitical situations.},

Perhaps the most progressive and at the same time funniest poet of the period."—Amiri BarakaPedro Pietri's often playfully absurd poems chronicle the joys and struggles of Nuyoricans—urban Puerto Ricans whose lives straddle the islands of Puerto Rico and Manhattan—and define the Latino experience in urban America. By turns angry, heartbreaking, and hopeful, his writings are imbued with a sense of pride and nationalism and were embraced by the generation of Latino poets that followed him. Pedro Pietri: Selected Poetry gathers the most enduring and treasured work among his published books, Puerto Rican Obituary, Traffic Violations, and Out of Order, along with a generous selection of his previously unpublished works.Pedro Pietri (1944–2004) was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and raised in Manhattan. In the early '70s he was a featured poet at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.Juan Flores (1943-2014) was a professor and director of Latino Studies at New York University, and author of many books on Puerto Rican and Latino culture.Pedro López Adorno is a professor in the Department of Africana and Puerto Rican/Latino Studies of Hunter College since 1987, and a published poet.},

By tracing out the conceptual influences underlying emotional and affectual geography, I seek to understand both the similarities and differences between their approaches. I identify three key areas of agreement: a relational ontology that privileges fluidity; a privileging of proximity and intimacy in their accounts; and a favouring of ethnographic methods. Even so, there is a fundamental disagreement, concerning the relationship 2013 or non-relationship 2013 between emotions and affect. Yet, this split raises awkward questions for both approaches, about how emotions and affect are to be understood and also about their geographies. As importantly, mapping the agreements and disagreements within emotional and affectual geography helps with an exploration of the political implications of this work. I draw upon psychoanalytic geography to suggest ways of addressing certain snags in both emotional and affectual geography.}

How are we not simply moved, but transformed—turned around—through the novel’s combination of gestural and affective structures? How might we think, in other words, about the correspondences between the novel’s technics and its tropes in its ability to assume meaning for us as a genre on a profound personal level? This essay explores the use of computational models to understand the novel’s relationship to the narration of profound change as a vehicle of readerly devotion. It aims to give us new techniques for thinking about the novel’s significance as a genre, a significance that depends less on forms of critical estrangement and more on felt experiences of pronounced transformation. In doing so, it outlines the potential impact that the practice of computational modeling might have on our own affective attachments as critical readers.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Despite this fact there is still relatively little conceptual and methodological discussion concerning borderland identities. This paper focuses firstly on the recent discussion of borders and identity, and secondly, it examines how narrative approach can contribute to our understanding of borderland identities. This is done by applying the narrative method to the analysis of individual border stories in the context of the Finnish‐Swedish border. Narrative method provides an in‐depth examination of the multidimensionality and multivoiceness in the construction of self. It is suggested that border scholars should be more critical when conceptualizing and classifying border identities in their empirical research. Identity can be linked with people's ethnic and linguistic ties but it often transforms through various border crossing practices and life projects. Borders materialize differently for different people, in different contexts and scales.},

Scholars in GIScience and digital geographies commonly argue that, compared to GIS, the geospatial web (geoweb) offers improved opportunities for Indigenous communities to make their own maps, contribute their own place-based content, and tell their own stories. Critical GIS has informed us about the potential issues with the use of spatial technologies in Indigenous contexts, which we synthesize into three themes: 1. compartmentalizing and distilling Indigenous knowledges, 2. undermining Indigenous ways of knowing and of transferring knowledges, and 3. exploiting and assimilating Indigenous knowledges. These three criteria are used to assess what Indigenous communities should examine when engaging with the geoweb and Indigenous knowledges. Our analysis focuses on issues of data ownership, access, sharing, and appropriation. We point to ways in which Indigenous peoples should carefully assess various components of the geoweb to avoid the misrepresentation, distortion, assimilation, exclusion, and exploitation of Indigenous knowledges and Indigenous ways of transmitting knowledge.

Inherent in postmodernism is the availability of a multitude of objects (or texts) available for reuse, reinterpretation, and appropriation under the umbrella of bricolage. The author discusses her development of schizocartography (the conflation of a phrase belonging to Félix Guattari) and how she has incorporated elements from Situationist psychogeography, Marxist geography, and poststructural theory and placed them alongside theories that examine subjectivity. This toolbox enables multiple possibilities for interpretation which reflect the actual heterogeneity of place and also mirror the complexities that are integral in challenging the totalizing perspective of space that capitalism encourages.},

As the sea levels rose, every street became a canal. Every skyscraper an island. For the residents of one apartment building in Madison Square, however, New York in the year 2140 is far from a drowned city. There is the market trader, who finds opportunities where others find trouble. There is the detective, whose work will never disappear --- along with the lawyers, of course.  There is the internet star, beloved by millions for her airship adventures, and the building's manager, quietly respected for his attention to detail. Then there are two boys who don't live there, but have no other home-- and who are more important to its future than anyone might imagine.Lastly there are the coders, temporary residents on the roof, whose disappearance triggers a sequence of events that threatens the existence of all-- and even the long-hidden foundations on which the city rests. New York 2140 is an extraordinary and unforgettable novel, from a writer uniquely qualified to the story of its future.For more from Kim Stanley Robinson, check out:2312AuroraShaman},

Yet Indigenous peoples themselves have long engaged in their own mapping practices to share ancestral knowledge, challenge colonial rule, and reclaim Indigenous “place-worlds.” Although there is now a sizable body of scholarly literature on the mapping of empire, this special issue on “Decolonizing the Map” aims to recenter Indigenous mappings and decolonial cartographies as spatial practices of world-making. In this introductory article, we provide an overview of the theory and praxis of decolonial mapping and outline the key themes of the contributions to the present special issue. Drawing upon insights from this edited collection, we conclude that decolonial mapping requires a recentering of Indigenous geographical knowledge, respect for Indigenous protocols, and the active participation of Indigenous peoples in the mapping process itself if the project of decolonizing the map is to truly move beyond the colonial cartographic frame.},

As traditionally told, this story begins in the 1950s with the arrival and triumph of V. S. Naipaul, George Lamming, and their peers in the London literary scene. However, Afro-Caribbeans were writing literature already in the 1840s as part of larger movements for political rights, economic opportunity, and social status. Rosenberg offers a history of this first one hundred years of anglophone Caribbean literature and a critique of Caribbean literary studies that explains its neglect. A historically contextualized study of both canonical and noncanonical writers, this book makes the case that the few well-known Caribbean writers from this earlier period - Claude McKay, Jean Rhys, and C. L. R. James - participated in a larger Caribbean literary movement that directly contributed to the rise of nationalism in the region. This movement reveals the prominence of Indian and other immigrant groups, of feminism, and of homosexuality in the formation of national literatures."--BOOK JACKET},

Particular attention is paid to the means of representing data in literary criticism, particularly through visualizations. The essays in this special issue are then discussed, with emphasis on the possibilities and conceptual difficulties that come with the representation of large aggregates in novel form.},

  abstract = {At a time characterized by the pervasive presence of – and enthusiasm for – maps in everyday life, interest in the cartographic humanities is growing among map scholars who approach cartography through a cultural lens. A mobility and humanities approach helps us move beyond the factual consideration of maps as mobile navigational devices that are used to move from one location to another. By considering mobility as a dense, elastic concept and adopting a humanistic perspective, I delineate a set of map mobilities emerging from the existing literature. A movement as process section focuses on post-representational, practice-based and historical approaches to mapping practices; a movement as elusiveness section focuses on material, more-than-human, surficial appreciations of cartographic objects; a movement as reimagination section focuses on theoretical, literary and art-based approaches to cartographic concepts. This focus on map mobilities illuminates the multiple theoretical and methodological possibilities of a renewed humanistic perspective in map studies.},

  abstract = {Scholars across the social sciences and humanities have increasingly questioned the meaning and purpose of critique. Contributing to those conversations, some geographers have advocated for affirmative or reparative practices such as reading for difference or experimentation that seek to provoke more joyful, hopeful, or enchanting affects, as alternatives to what they perceive as a prevailing forms of ?negative? critique. In response, others have re-emphasized the centrality of negativity and revalued negative affects in the context of regimes of racialization, heteronormativity, and coloniality. Rather than taking sides in a debate thus framed, this article develops an ambivalent position that foregrounds multiple senses of difference that exist within affirmative and reparative projects. Drawing on feminist and queer geographic work, the explicitly political and difference-oriented writing of Sedgwick and Deleuze, and queer and postcolonial affect scholars, we argue for critique characterized by an ambivalent and pluralistic attitude toward feeling. Joining those arguing for a pluralization of the moods and modes of critical work, our readings suggest the necessity of a pluralism that refuses any escape from the ?negativity? of the social field in favor of an affectively ambivalent engagement with the inherent politics of critique in a plural and uneven world.},

The problem with such definitions is that they cannot distinguish fiction from counterfactual statements, or from the reports of dreams, wishes and fantasies which occur in the context of natural discourse. This paper attempts to capture the difference, as well as the similarities, between fiction and other language uses involving statements about non-existing worlds by comparing their respective behavior in the light of an interpretive principle which will be referred to as the “principle of minimal departure”. This principle states that whenever we interpret a message concerning an alternate world, we reconstrue this world as being the closest possible to the reality we know. In the non-factuals of natural discourse the referents of the pronouns I and you are reconstrued as retaining the personality of the actual speaker as fully as possible, but in fiction they are immune to the principle of minimal departure.},

  abstract = {This essay explores how theoretical physics, narratology, and narrative itself deal with the idea that reality consists of a plurality of worlds. In physics, the existence of parallel universes has been postulated on the cosmic level to describe what lies on the other side of black holes and, on the level of subatomic particles, to avoid the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. In narratology, the philosophical idea of a plurality of possible worlds and the contrast between the actual and the possible provide a model of the cognitive pattern into which readers organize information in order to interpret it as a story. But the many-worlds interpretation of physics and the possible worlds (PW) model of narrative differ in their conception of the ontological status of the multiple worlds: in physics they are all actual, while narrative theory stresses the contrast between actuality and mere possibility. This does not mean that the PW model is incompatible with the many-worlds cosmology proposed by physics: faced with a narrative that presents multiple realities as existing objectively, the theory would simply claim that the actual domain is made up of a number of different worlds and that the distinction actual/nonactual repeats itself within each of these parts. The last section of the essay explores what it takes for a narrative to impose a many-worlds cosmology, distinguishing these narratives from other texts that present contradictory versions of facts and situating them with respect to three types of story common in fantasy and science fiction: the narrative of transworld exploration, the narrative of alternate history, and the time-travel narrative.},

He chronicled these events in a diary that he kept at great personal risk." "Written as a simple account of what Sakowicz witnessed, the diary is devoid of personal involvement or identification with the victims. It is thus a unique document: testimony from a bystander, an "objective" observer without an emotional or political agenda, to the extermination of the Jews of the city known as "the Jerusalem of Lithuania."" "Sakowicz did not survive the war, but much of his diary did. Painstakingly pieced together by Rachel Margolis from scraps of paper hidden in various locations, the diary was published in Polish in 1999. It is here published in English for the first time, extensively annotated by Yitzhak Arad to guide readers through the events at Ponary."--BOOK JACKET},

As a thinking tool, “humble geographies” can combine insights and ethics from posthuman and feminist philosophies, participatory action research, and situated knowledges. Humility could helpfully contribute in debates seeking to improve geographic research practice. Humility, a quiet virtue, has potential to inspire change in the ways we relate with others and our institutions. Drawing on research experiences in the high Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, I give some examples of humble geographies in practice that raise questions about the ideal balance between authority and humility. How can we be humble in the face of rising pressures to sell ourselves and our research as highly impactful and important – in short, anything but humble? My aim is to open a discussion as to how we can helpfully inject more humility into our work.},

Anglophone Marxian social science has changed dramatically since then; this article attempts to assess the role of the~Grundrisse in these changes, focusing specifically on anthropology and geography. In geography the effects are most apparent in the work of David Harvey, who was among the earliest Anglophone social scientists to undertake a full reinterpretation of Marx in the light of the~Grundrisse. I identify four insights that can be seen in Harvey's writings and elsewhere in recent human geography, but whose relation to the~Grundrisse is not often acknowledged. In anthropology, the effects of the~Grundrisse are perhaps even more pronounced but also more complex and obscure; nonetheless, a similar, and similarly under-acknowledged, influence can be discerned, especially in historical anthropology and recent studies of value. I suggest that the~Grundrisse's translation into English has facilitated a convergence of anthropology and geography, and that critical ethnography in this vein is needed to grapple with the financialization of everything, in which commodification is only a preliminary step.}

  abstract = {GIS eased into geography without much discord until the 1990s, when a flurry of commentaries about the relative merits of GIS made their way into a number of geographic journals. The ensuing decade was marked by varying degrees of friction between GIS practitioners and their critics in human geography. Despite the methodological chasm between the two groups, little discussion of the implications of these differences has ensued. This article fills that gap with a historiographic examination of critiques of GIS. Critiques of GIS are organized into three waves or periods, each characterized by distinct arguments. The first wave, from 1990 to 1994, was marked by the intensity of debate as well as an emphasis on positivism. By 1995, the conversation waned as the number of critics grew, while GIS practitioners increasingly declined comment. This second wave marked the initiation of a greater degree of co-operation between GIS scholars and their critics, however. With the inception of the National Center for Geographic Information Analysis (NCGIA) Initiative 19, intended to study the social effects of GIS, many critics began to work closely with their peers in GIS. In the third wave, critiques of GIS expressed a greater commitment to the technology. Throughout the decade, debates about the technology shifted from simple attacks on positivism to incorporating more subtle analyses of the effects of the technology. These critiques have had considerable effect on the academic GIS community but are presently constrained by limited communication with GIS practitioners because of the absence of a common vocabulary. I argue that, if critiques of GIS are to be effective, they must find a way to address GIS researchers, using the language and conceptual framework of the discipline.},

  abstract = {There have been several obstacles to an embrace of critical theoretical work in GIScience; chief among them is the barrier between conceptualization and formalization. Early critics of the technology were not cognizant that technological change must be implemented within the language of code. While critics expressed their concerns in a theoretical and esoteric language, increasingly GIScientists are at pains to address the same issues so that solutions can be incorporated into software technologies. Indeed an implicit recognition of the important divide between informal and formal environments has aided GIScience researchers in developing strategies to represent multiple epistemologies in GIS. The article begins with a review of early critical GIScience, examines the degree of its acceptance in the light of a content analysis of GIS journals, and then illustrates that the issue of multiple representation of the same reality is being addressed under the rubric of ontologies. New research in this area has had significant impact on GIScience because it has been articulated and addressed at both the conceptual and formal stages—a criterion for real changes to both GISystems and GIScience. The article concludes with an examination of why critical GIS remains relevant to the discipline, in spite of efforts to address issues of representation within GIScience.},

He argues that centrally managed social plans derail when they impose schematic visions that do violence to complex interdependencies that are not - and cannot be - fully understood. Further the success of designs for social organization depends on the recognition that local, practical knowledge is as important as formal, epistemic knowledge. The author builds a persuasive case against "development theory" and imperialistic state planning that disregards the values, desires, and objections of its subjects. And in discussing these planning disasters, he identifies four conditions common to them all: the state's attempt to impose administrative order on nature and society; a high-modernist ideology that believes scientific intervention can improve every aspect of human life; a willingness to use authoritarian state power to effect large-scale innovations; and a prostrate civil society that cannot effectively resist such plans},

In June 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple with two young sons, were led separately from their prison cells on Death Row and electrocuted moments apart. Both had been convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union, despite the fact that the US government was aware that the evidence against Ethel was shaky at best and based on the perjury of her own brother. This book is the first to focus on one half of that couple for more than thirty years, and much new evidence has surfaced since then. Ethel was a bright girl who might have fulfilled her personal dream of becoming an opera singer, but instead found herself struggling with the social mores of the 1950's. She longed to be a good wife and perfect mother to her two small boys, while battling the political paranoia of the McCarthy era, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and a mother who never valued her. Because of her profound love for and loyalty to her husband, she refused to incriminate him, despite government pressure on her to do so. Instead, she courageously faced the death penalty for a crime she hadn't committed, orphaning her two young sons. Seventy years after her trial, this is the first time Ethel's story has been told with the full use of the dramatic and tragic prison letters she exchanged with her husband, her lawyer and her psychotherapist over a three-year period, two of them in solitary confinement. Hers is the resonant story of what happens when a government motivated by fear tramples on the rights of its citizens"--},

  abstract = {In this paper we construct an object-oriented approach to power and politics. Building on the work of Graham Harman, we argue that objects are engines of power, able to fully shape the contours of existence through the production of difference and affectivity in the world. We present four key points to underpin our argument. First, we define an object by expanding on the Heideggerian idea that objects are split between their ‘present qualities’ and ‘absent qualities’. Second, we discuss why objects are irreducible to scientific naturalism or social relativism. Third, we contend that the world is ‘policed’ by objects that act as phenomenological viruses. And finally, we explain that such policing is never exhaustive and autonomous forces are constitutive of new commons. We conclude that a speculative metaphysics is vital for building new geographic understandings of objects and power, and a politics of action – one brick at a time.},

  abstract = {This paper argues for the political importance of Alain Badiou’s ‘site’ in human geography. A site is a place of radical politics capable of destroying old worlds and creating new ones. Badiou’s recently published Logics of worlds (2009, Continuum, London) is an account of how worlds come to exist. Critical to understanding this work is Badiou’s critique of ‘democratic materialism’, an umbrella term used for Deleuzian and postmodern philosophies, defined by the phrase: ‘there are only bodies and languages’. Badiou counters this with his ‘materialist dialectic’, which emphasises the intervention truth can make in a world: ‘there are only bodies and languages, except that there are truths’. The subversion of the appearance of a world by the infinite potential of the site is cast as the emergence of a truth. Current theorisations of the site in human geography do not take into account truth as a political category. The paper is thus a defence of the site as an exceptional place of politics, where the materialist dialectic conviction: ‘except that there are truths’ is rendered visible.1},

In this paper we draw out some characteristics, properties, and implications of this emergent paradigm, especially documenting some novel mobile theories and methods.

Their construction of dialectics as inconsistent with poststructural thinking, difference, and assemblages is based, however, on a Hegelian conception of the dialectic. This Hegelian imaginary reflects the intellectual history of radical and/or critical anglophone geography. Yet, dialectics can be read in a non-Hegelian, much less totalizing and teleological, and more geographical way. This broader reading opens up space for considering parallels between dialectics, the assemblages of Deleuze and Guattari, and aspects of complexity theory.}

This ‘Manifesto' argues that, born in a form of cultural studies, topology offers 21st-century researchers a model for mapping the dynamics of time as well as space, allowing the rigorous description of events, situations, changing cultural formations and social spatializations. Law and Mol's network spaces, Serre's folded time, Massey’s ‘power geometries’, Lefebvre's ‘production of space’ and ‘rhythmanalysis’ can be developed through a cultural topological sensitivity that allows time to be understood as not only progressive but cyclical, relationships and the ‘reach’ of power can be understood through ‘knots', and a topology of experience to model the ‘plushness of the Real' via extra- and over-dimensioned time-spaces that capture nuance while drawing on systematic conceptual resources.},

Looking at the American 1930s, the dissertation considers four literary objects, James Farrell's Studs Lonigan trilogy, John Dos Passos's U.S.A., Ernest Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls and Sinclair Lewis's It Can't Happen Here. Using a contemporary arguments over speculative realist ontologies as well as the "flat ontology" suggested by site-based human geography, I argue that novels maintained their ability to work as political agents when considered beyond symptomatic readings that fix human individuals within a system of domination. Instead, entities consisting of both human and non-human actors, "sites," allow multiple, heteroglottic worlds to flourish within the novel, reflecting against the multiple worlds in which the reader finds herself. Reading this way solicits from the texts a mode of realism that reveals the experimental, creative possibilities inherent in a flattened ontology. As a result, every novel is a box of revolutionary building blocks, waiting for a new construction.},

  abstract = {"Elements of Yiddish Style: Sensibility in the Late Soviet Union in Comparative Perspective" addresses the ways in which Soviet artists made strategic use of a certain kind of Yiddish speech style in Russian-language literature and performance in the 1960s and 1970s. Further, it explores how a parallel style is detectable in English-language American texts of the same era, and it shows how this secular but still identifiably Jewish style contributed to a larger postwar sensibility that was accessible and appealing to Jews and non-Jews in both places. As a literary history of this historical phenomenon, "Elements of Yiddish Style" begins with two paradoxes. First, according to most scholarship, Yiddish literature, theater, and song flourished in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and early 1930s as part of a state-sponsored effort to fashion a modern, secular Jewish public that was integrated into Soviet society. World War II, the assassination of actor and director Solomon Mikhoels, and the murder of five prominent Yiddish poets in 1952 marked the effective end of Yiddish literature and Jewish public culture. This narrative suggests that free artistic production in Yiddish for a sizeable audience in the Soviet Union was all but terminated. However, examination of artistic production from the 1960s and 1970s reveals that a certain kind of Yiddish-linked Jewish artistic style thrived after the death of Stalin despite these violent ruptures. This style continued to develop throughout the second half of the twentieth century and diffuse throughout Soviet culture. It is visible in writing in Yiddish, but it was especially influential and accessible in Russian translations of Yiddish and in Russian works with Yiddish interjections and other elements of a Jewish verbal repertoire. It appealed to an ethnically diverse audience and can be observed both in sophisticated texts composed for an elite audience and in highly popular songs, films, and children's books. "Elements of Yiddish Style" tells the story of this style and the larger aesthetic sensibility of which it was a part. Second, postwar Soviet and American Jewish experiences are often assumed to be very different. Broadly stated, scholarly narratives have focused on limited access to Jewish culture in the Soviet Union and on Jewish assimilation into the middle class in the United States. However, the particular kind of Jewish language and style that I identify can be observed in Soviet and American texts of the same postwar era. While acknowledging the specificity of each artist and his context, this dissertation also asks what can be made of the presence of this Jewish style as an element of major-language art in both places and across media and levels of sophistication, and it seeks to identify the reigning discourses that can explain the common appetite for Jewish speech style. "Elements of Yiddish Style" argues that, in a postwar era when the expansion of ideologies of monolingualism stimulated and enabled the counterculture desire for language that felt forbidden, forgotten, dangerous, strange or playful, Jews and Jewishness in both places made Yiddish uniquely well suited to fulfilling these desires. Yiddish was imagined as a language that barely survived but persisted, albeit in a form that acknowledged permanent loss, and so it could be used as a symbol of the persistence and adaptability of other endangered enterprises, such as literary modernism and the humanist ideals behind socialism. It was also a language that was seen as an absorptive, adaptive product of diaspora and inherently polylingual. These qualities made the language a feisty and appealing answer to the standardized major languages of former empires and contemporary superpowers, as well as to the controlled traditions and ideologies that those languages were perceived as representing. Finally, it was imagined as a language of intimate identity. Elements of Yiddish could create a feeling of creative intimacy among audiences, even when those elements were embedded in media such as songs or popular film that utilized the technologies that were seen as threatening intimate experiences of art in the first place. In turn, Jewish artists made use of the creative opportunities that the market for the linguistic nonstandard created. Investigating the topic of Jewish style in predominantly Russian and English works by secular writers requires taking seriously something that some people think was not there, should not have been there, or is somehow distasteful or taboo to hear as Jewish. Such concerns bespeak the success of the style itself, because these texts and performances were produced with a kind of deniability that was part of their appeal. This deniability—this reserving of the right to claim despite the unmistakable use of Yiddish that traces of Jewishness weren't there or didn't matter in the way this dissertation claims—accompanied and enhanced the kinds of irony and playfulness that typify these texts and the tastes of their audiences. This dissertation, therefore, is an exercise in examining a style that left evidence but also covered its tracks, and it is an inquiry into why it was so satisfying to access this almost ineffable space. In exposing how and why elements of Yiddish speech culture were useful to postwar writers and compelling to their audiences, "Elements of Yiddish Style" celebrates these materials and their creators, engages with the difficult questions they raise, and helps us better understand postwar secular Jewish culture as a transnational phenomenon.},

And it may be studded with funkier adverts for 501 jeans but this hardly elevates it definitively beyond MTV’s staple fare. With one exception. Postmodern MTV is not heavy metal; heavy metal macho would seem to be the epitome of a decayed modernism in music, and it too occupies much of MTV’s airtime.},

The disruption of this “given” postwar geography in the intervening two decades and of the political, economic and cultural assumptions that went with it could barely have been predicted in the early 1970s (but see Mandel 1975, 310–42 for a prescient discussion; Rowthorn 1971; Murray 1971). Certainly the development of a “European Economic Community”, equalizing conditions of trade in several commodities between six countries beginning in the early 1950s, and the steady growth of a more fully fledged “Common Market” served notice that some disruption of the traditional economic geography (at least at the national scale) was afoot. Nonetheless, the reconstruction of Europe at all spatial scales that would follow the 1970s economic depressions in the West and the post-1989 implosion of official Communist Party rule in the East were quite unforeseeable. Thereby, the largely economic evolution of the Common Market into the European Community in the 1970s and 1980s and now into the more politically inspired European Union was bound up with a much more complex and halting entanglement of social, cultural and political as well as economic restructurings.},

As was noted in an earlier discussion of aspects of his work, Soja's trilogy – Postmodern Geographies (1989), Thirdspace (1996) and Postmetropolis (2000) – is ‘an exciting enterprise, superbly written, showing great insight and increasing catholicity and generosity towards a wide range of work’ (Catterall, ‘It All Came Together in New York? Urban Studies and the Present Crisis’, CITY, Vol.6, No.1, 2002). But it is more than that. It is a reconceptualisation of the field that puts it in touch with and contributes to the recasting of contemporary, transdisciplinary social analysis. It includes, as his personal introduction below to key aspects of his work indicates: a rejection of binary divisions that set, for example, Marxist and postmodern approaches apart; an emphasis on and exploration of the notion of synekism (the stimulus of urban agglomeration), and of the essential spatiality of urban phenomena; and – unexpectedly, for those still coming to terms with the spatial turn – a related reconsideration of urban history (including a prequel of 5,000 years added to, and necessitating the rethinking of the established account of, ‘the Urban Revolution’).},

  abstract = {Literary historians have long been interested in sociological approaches to literature. The field of modernism, a major aesthetic movement that flourished between 1915-40 primarily in the United States, England, and Europe, but the rest of the world as well, has been seen as a particularly compelling site to explore the sociological underpinnings of art. It is in this movement that many of our ideas of the “autonomy of art” and the “genius” of the artist emerged, and scholars such as Lawrence Rainey have produced excellent, archive-driven accounts of the institutions, patronage systems, and personal networks that conditioned and produced this field of production. In this essay, we exploit new methods of aggregating vast amounts of bibliographic data and new network visualization tools to “scale up” this sociological approach to modernism. While scholars such as Rainey have been limited by the contours of specific institutional or writer archives, and the self-reported accounts of the field by the writers themselves, our approach transforms large empirical bibliographic data, regarding which poets published where and when, into network visualizations that provide a panoptic view of the modernist field as a whole. We then use these visualizations to develop a body of new conceptual categories, such as “brokerage” and “closure,” to analyze the structural relations between poets and how their interactions help to constitute the field of modernist poetry as a whole.},

In this article, I apply the concept of rasquachismo to interpreting the clandestine border-crossing strategies that Mexican migrants pursue as a way of resisting intensive efforts by the U.S. government to police their movements. More specifically, I describe the types of movidas rascuaches (rascuache maneuvers) practiced by migrants whom I encountered as I conducted ethnographic fieldwork along the South Texas-Northeast Mexico border in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Drawing upon the theoretical reflections of French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, I argue that the rasquache sensibility forms an integral part of the habitus of Mexican migrants that inspires the compendium of border-crossing movidas in which they engage.},

  abstract = {Anarchism and geography have a long and disjointed history, characterized by towering peaks of intensive intellectual engagement and low troughs of ambivalence and disregard. This paper traces a genealogy of anarchist geographies back to the modern development of anarchism into a distinct political philosophy following the Enlightenment. The initial rise of geographers’ engagement with anarchism occurred at the end of the 19th-century, owing to Élisée Reclus and Peter Kropotkin, who developed an emancipatory vision for geography in spite of the discipline’s enchantment with imperialism at that time. The realpolitik of the war years in the first half of the 20th-century and the subsequent quantitative revolution in geography represent a nadir for anarchist geographies. Yet anarchism was never entirely abandoned by geographical thought and the counterculture movement of the 1970s gave rise to radical geography, which included significant interest in anarchist ideas. Unfortunately another low occurred during the surge of neoliberal politics in the 1980s and early 1990s, but hope springs eternal, and from the late 1990s onward the anti-globalization movement and DIY culture have pushed anarchist geographies into more widespread currency. In reviewing the literature, I hope to alert readers to the ongoing and manifold potential for anarchist geographies to inform both geographical theory and importantly, to give rise to more practice-based imperatives where building solidarities, embracing reciprocity, and engaging in mutual aid with actors and communities beyond the academy speaks to the ‘freedom of geography’ and its latent capacity to shatter its own disciplinary circumscriptions.},

In its rejection of such multivariate apparatuses of domination, this article is a proverbial call to non-violent arms for those geographers and non-geographers alike who seek to put an end to the seemingly endless series of tragedies, misfortunes, and catastrophes that characterize the miasma and malevolence of the current neoliberal moment. But this is not simply a demand for the end of neoliberalism and its replacement with a more moderate and humane version of capitalism, nor does it merely insist upon a more egalitarian version of the state. It is instead the resurrection of a prosecution within geography that dates back to the discipline's earliest days: anarchism!},

This article presents a theoretical and methodological framework for engaging the emerging geoweb as part of a longer tradition of research into society and technology. A close reading of Microsoft’s Pedestrian Route Production patent, dubbed the “avoid ghetto GPS”, is used to construct two ideal type futures—one hopeful and one frightening. One where spatial technology ensures efficiency, safety, and new forms of coordination, while the other algorithmically sorts society by race and class. Despite not yet and potentially never existing, the patent offers a viable means through which potential futures are made real in the present. Through comparative analysis of these futures, their underlying commonalities are drawn out, revealing the relationship between technology and the delimitation of human experience. This analysis avoids grand narratives and teleological arguments, while making it possible to draw forth the unthought acceptance within each ideal type for the future: the continuing shift of human life itself towards a teleological, always already-calculated standing-reserve. The work on technology of Martin Heidegger and Herbert Marcuse (re)situate the geoweb within long-standing theoretical work on technology and its role in society, modernity, and capitalism.},

A deceptively simple tale, Petals of Blood~is on the surface a suspenseful investigation of a spectacular triple murder in upcountry Kenya. Yet as the intertwined stories of the four suspects unfold, a devastating picture emerges of a modern third-world nation whose frustrated people feel their leaders have failed them time after time. First published in 1977, this novel was so explosive that its author was imprisoned without charges by the Kenyan government. His incarceration was so shocking that newspapers around the world called attention to the case, and protests were raised by human-rights groups, scholars, and writers, including James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Donald Barthelme, Harold Pinter, and Margaret Drabble.},

Its effect has been to multiply both the number of inhabitations that are understood to exist and the sensory registers through which they can be characterized. Most particularly, this proliferation of inhabitations has meant that nearness has been replaced by distribution as a guiding metaphor and ambition. The paper is in three parts. Using the work of Julie Mehretu as a guide, the first part considers the different ways in which space makes a difference. The second part then uses three vignettes to understand the range of spaces that can be produced and how they become attuned. Finally, there is a brief conclusion.},

Bianco have argued, many of the data-driven initiatives that have earned DH its most visible accolades eschew rather than engage topics of difference and identity.¹ Though a number of queer studies and digital humanities scholars have already begun bringing queer perspectives to DH, much of this work remains marginal within the larger DH field.},

A work of enormous range and subtlety, Lefebvre takes as his starting-point and guide the “trivial” details of quotidian experience: an experience colonized by the commodity, shadowed by inauthenticity, yet one which remains the only source of resistance and change.This is an enduringly radical text, untimely today only in its intransigence and optimism.},

To understand how those patterns of preference changed across a century, we gathered two samples of English-language poetry from the period 1820–1919: one drawn from volumes reviewed in prominent periodicals and one selected at random from a large digital library (in which the majority of authors are relatively obscure). The stylistic differences associated with literary prominence turn out to be quite stable: a statistical model trained to distinguish reviewed from random volumes in any quarter of this century can make predictions almost as accurate about the rest of the period. The “poetic revolutions” described by many histories are not visible in this model; instead, there is a steady tendency for new volumes of poetry to change by slightly exaggerating certain features that defined prestige in the recent past.},

  abstract = {"This remarkable book traces the quest for the truth about the Holocaust in Lithuania by two ostensible enemies: Rūta a descendant of the perpetrators, Efraim a descendant of the victims. Rūta Vanagaitė, a successful Lithuanian writer, was motivated by her recent discoveries that some of her relatives had played a role in the mass murder of Jews and that Lithuanian officials had tried to hide the complicity of local collaborators. Efraim Zuroff, a noted Israeli Nazi hunter, had both professional and personal motivations. He had worked for years to bring Lithuanian war criminals to justice and to compel local authorities to tell the truth about the Holocaust in their country. The facts that his maternal grandparents were born in Lithuania and that he was named for a great-uncle who was murdered with his family in Vilnius with the active help of Lithuanians made his search personal as well. Our People exposes the significant role in implementing the Final Solution played by local political leaders and the prewar Lithuanian administration that remained in place during the Nazi occupation. It also tackles the sensitive issue of the motivation of thousands of ordinary Lithuanians who were complicit in the murder of their Jewish neighbors. At the heart of the book, these are the issues that Rūta and Efraim discuss, debate, and analyze as they crisscross the country to visit dozens of Holocaust mass murder sites in Lithuania and neighboring Belarus. This book follows them on their remarkable journey as they search for neglected graves, interview eyewitnesses, and uncover hints of the rich life that had existed in hundreds of Jewish communities throughout Lithuania."-- Provided by the publisher},

As a concept, network has been highly conducive to theorizing phenomena and processes such as globalization, digital media (Internet), speed, symbiosis and complexity. This in turn enables us to rethink what constitutes the foundations of intelligence, knowledge and even life itself. One particularly useful application of network as a concept is the notion of the gift, which is often seen as the archetypical figure for understanding the nature of economics and social relationships.},

I will argue that the lack of a proper conceptualization of intermediate-scale entities such as interpersonal networks, organizations or social movements in network governance hampers the introduction of post-liberal concepts of democracy into network governance. In the second part of the article I introduce DeLanda's theory of social complexity, which is a development of DeuleuzoGuattarian Assemblage Theory. I propose it as an ontological foundation for network governance research. Assemblage theory connects to concepts of minor and major politics. In the third part of the article I present a concept of `minor governance' in order to revisit democratic network governance.},

Bringing together sixty-three essays, from humanists, historians, anthropologists, sociologists, among others, each focused on a single term, the volume reveals the broad range of the field while also illuminating the tensions and contestations surrounding issues of language, politics, and histories of colonization, specific to this area of study. From "borderlands" to "migration," from "citizenship" to "mestizaje," this accessible volume will be informative for those who are new to Latina/o studies, providing them with a mapping of the current debates and a trajectory of the development of the field, as well as being a valuable resource for scholars to expand their knowledge and critical engagement with the dynamic transformations in the field},

By drawing on Hungary's post-1990 state spatial reforms, this paper discusses a major limitation of state theoretical frameworks. In particular, the paper seeks to challenge state theorists’ generally subtle but persistent bias to capitalist economic structures, and argues that the above bias impedes an adequate and effectively critical account of state spatial regulation. Finally, it makes a case for a perspective on new state spaces that acknowledges the wider socio-historical embeddedness of state space production, as well as its inherently political nature.},

By focusing specifically on the changing nature of slave childhood in Jamaica, Vasconcellos examines how childhood and slavery influenced and changed each other throughout this period of study, with the abolitionist movement standing as the main catalyst for change. With each chapter focusing on a different aspect of the slave experience, this monograph explores a childhood that was defined by planter opinion and manipulation, but one that was increasingly affected by the complex processes of slavery, abolition, and eventually emancipation. In doing so, this study reveals a great deal about slave family and childhood from the inside, shining new light on the experiences of slave children and slave families in Jamaica"--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {Since its publication, Marxists have debated the relation between the~Grundrisse and the first volume of~Capital. This paper offers one entry point into this debate by comparing the way each text frames its "problematic of uneven development", that is, the way that capitalism's inherently uneven development is thematized as a problem for explanation. In the~Grundrisse the uneven nature of capitalism as development is explained by the emergence of capitalism from precapitalist relations. While this analysis is not entirely absent from~Capital (cf the discussion of primitive accumulation), precapitalist formations are not treated as systematically in~Capital. By contrast, uneven development enters~Capital in the final section, particularly where Marx criticizes Wakefield. Reading these two texts together, I argue that the problematic of uneven development shifts from~Grundrisse to~Capital in a way that underscores Marx's growing stress on capital's imperial character. This shift has its roots in political events of the period when Marx rewrote~Grundrisse into~Capital.}

  abstract = {Antipode~was launched into the firmament of the 1970s. We might reflect upon how well the journal and its contributors fully appreciated the historical gravity and weight of what was surrounding the project to create "a radical journal of geography". What sort of radicalism was on offer? The language was "social relevance" from "a radical (Left) political viewpoint". In writing to celebrate~Antipode's birthday, this time in another, and similar, firmament there is still the need to confront the challenge of radicalism and its meanings. Whether we agree with Perry Anderson that the last vestiges of the 1960s have been finally swept away, that the "fluent vision" of the Right has no equivalent on the Left and that embedded liberalism is now as remote as "Arian bishops", where do radical alternatives stand in relation to the fractured hegemony of neoliberalism? At the very least the need for alternatives is more pressing than ever. David Harvey has proposed rethinking the idea of "the right to the city". But what other rights might we rethink? I reflect upon this question by returning to the 1960s and 1970s and Marxist debates over the law, and by thinking about the possibilities offered by this Polanyian moment.}

We think of the FBI as America's police force. But secret intelligence is the Bureau's first and foremost mission. Enemies is the story of how presidents have used the FBI to conduct political warfare, and how the Bureau became the most powerful intelligence service the United States possesses. Here is the hidden history of America's hundred-year war on terror. The FBI has fought against terrorists, spies, anyone it deemed subversive--and sometimes American presidents. The FBI's secret intelligence and surveillance techniques have created a tug-of-war between national security and civil liberties. It is a tension that strains the very fabric of a free republic. --Publisher description},

  abstract = {A preliminary dynamical analysis of landscapes and humans as hierarchical complex systems suggests that strong coupling between the two that spreads to become regionally or globally pervasive should be focused at multi-year to decadal time scales. At these scales, landscape dynamics is dominated by water, sediment and biological routing mediated by fluvial, oceanic, atmospheric processes and human dynamics is dominated by simplifying, profit-maximizing market forces and political action based on projection of economic effect. Also at these scales, landscapes impact humans through patterns of natural disasters and trends such as sea level rise; humans impact landscapes by the effect of economic activity and changes meant to mitigate natural disasters and longer term trends. Based on this analysis, human-landscape coupled systems can be modeled using heterogeneous agents employing prediction models to determine actions to represent the nonlinear behavior of economic and political systems and rule-based routing algorithms to represent landscape processes. A cellular model for the development of New Orleans illustrates this approach, with routing algorithms for river and hurricane-storm surge determining flood extent, five markets (home, labor, hotel, tourism and port services) connecting seven types of economic agents (home buyers/laborers, home developers, hotel owners/ employers, hotel developers, tourists, port services developer and port services owners/employers), building of levees or a river spillway by political agents and damage to homes, hotels or port services within cells determined by the passage or depth of flood waters. The model reproduces historical aspects of New Orleans economic development and levee construction and the filtering of frequent small-scale floods at the expense of large disasters.},

  abstract = {The past 25 years have seen a proliferation of interest in GIS among humanists and humanistic social scientists. Under various banners – historical GIS, qualitative and mixed methods GIS, spatial and digital history, digital humanities, spatial humanities or geohumanities – researchers have developed new ways to include qualitative data within the framework of GIS. At the same time, social and theoretical critiques of GIS as a tool wielded chiefly by and for those in power have increased awareness of its limitations, particularly for studying human perceptions, experiences, and the meanings of place. We agree with a growing chorus of geographers that the most common data structures in GIS are inadequate to capture or analyze the relational dimensions of subjectivity. As part of the solution, we propose an alternative hybrid framework that prioritizes topological relationships while retaining coordinate locations as points of connection between geographic places and experiential evidence. This article explains how the challenges posed by Holocaust survivor testimony inspired us to pursue inductive spatial analysis and non-coordinate means of mapping. We then set out a model for a topological GIS and illustrate its application with two survivor testimonies and a map of their experiences.},

In this article we argue that these changes to citizenship rely on legally articulated understandings of the relationship between people and place that are particular and restrictive, but that are also mutable and subject to change. We examine the ways in which this relationship has changed, with particular reference to the State, the Family and Woman. Using insights from critical geographies of the law, scale and mobility, we also highlight ways in which this relationship may be challenged.},

Mark Spitz is a member of one of the three-person civilian sweeper units tasked with clearing lower Manhattan of the remaining feral zombies.

And then things start to go terribly wrong…At once a chilling horror story and a literary novel by a contemporary master, Zone One is a dazzling portrait of modern civilization in all its wretched, shambling glory.},

  abstract = {Critical research on migration, borders and camps has used the notion of biopolitics to interrogate how sovereign power or the state differentiate and govern the life of mobile populations. Yet despite its popularity, biopolitical theory is not without limitations, particularly when used as an analytic lens for empirical research. Many theorists of biopolitics are concerned with grand historical shifts and binary oppositions between life and death, inclusion and exclusion, bare life and political rights. Such binaries have been challenged by recent research that points to complex and nuanced differentiations of belonging and citizenship, to the ambiguity of power relations, and that prioritizes the agency and experience of individuals over structuralist conceptions of oppression. Against this background, I suggest that assemblage thinking and the works of Deleuze and Guattari offer terms and concepts that can be made useful to reconsider biopolitics as an analytic approach. Assemblage thinking challenges traditional oppositions between the individual and the collective, structure and agency, oppression and resistance and may thus be more sensitive to the complexity of power relations that integrate the life of migrants. In particular, I examine how revised conceptions of power, life, difference and population challenge the assumption of a central origin of power and an understanding of biopolitics as spatially or historically confined. By considering biopolitics as multiple and becoming, analysis can become more sensitive to the biopolitical experience of migrants, and to the formation of alternative collectives and subjectivities that challenge the violent biopolitics of contemporary migration regimes.},

Inspired by maps made by the Surrealists, by the Situationists, by Pop Artists, and especially by Conceptualists of every stripe, artists in increasing numbers have taken up the map as an expressive medium. In an age less and less enamored of traditional forms of representation – and increasingly critical – maps have numerous attractions for artists. Beyond their formal continuities, maps and paintings are both communicative, that is, constructs intended to affect behavior. As the energy of painting has been dispersed over the past half century into earth art, conceptual art, installation art, performance art, video art, cyber art, and so on, it has dispersed the map as a subject along with it. The irresistible tug maps exert on artists arises from the map’s mask of neutral objectivity, from its mask of unauthored dispassion. Artists either strip this mask off the map, or fail to put one on. In either case artists simultaneously point to the mask worn by the map, while they enter unmasked into the very discourse of the map. In so doing map artists are erasing the line cartographers have tried to draw between their form of graphic communication (maps) and others (drawings, paintings, and so on). In this way map artists are reclaiming the map as a discourse function for people in general. The flourishing of map art signals the imminent demise of the map as a privileged form of communication. The map is dead! Long live the map!},

For August and her girls, sharing confidences as they ambled through neighborhood streets, Brooklyn was a place where they believed that they were beautiful, talented, brilliant—a part of a future that belonged to them.But beneath the hopeful veneer, there was another Brooklyn, a dangerous place where grown men reached for innocent girls in dark hallways, where ghosts haunted the night, where mothers disappeared. A world where madness was just a sunset away and fathers found hope in religion. Like Louise Meriwether’s Daddy Was a Number Runner and Dorothy Allison’s Bastard Out of Carolina, Jacqueline Woodson’s Another Brooklyn heartbreakingly illuminates the formative time when childhood gives way to adulthood—the promise and peril of growing up—and exquisitely renders a powerful, indelible, and fleeting friendship that united four young lives.},

Our previous work in this area aimed at developing the concept of the site – via site ontology – as an ‘event-space’ that describes the differential contours and pressures of aggregating and dispersing bodies. This paper’s contribution lies in considering how politics and political potentials are specified by such event-spaces. In geography and other fields, politics has nearly always been thought to proceed from and to exist for subjects, regardless of how they get theorized. Here we explore how the site might initiate politics that neither presuppose nor undergird individual subject positionalities or mass identitarian categories. We argue that subjectivity – widely understood to be the motive force in organizing politics – is often ‘suspended’ where bodies encounter or get enlisted in the unanticipated connections and relations that site ontology describes. Thus, our account understands the site as autonomous with respect to the subject in two crucial ways. The site is: (1) organizationally autonomous: its rules emerge from its specific, localized relations and this material immanence makes the site the legislator of its own assembly; and (2) politically autonomous: that is, not conditioned by the political schemata of subjectivity per se, even though sites diversely and differently enlist and reshuffle bodies that often attend to, direct, participate in, and inhabit subjective politics.},

  abstract = {Is GIS a tool or a science? The question is clearly important in the day-to-day operations of geography departments. Departments need to know if GIS is a tool that should be taught at the undergraduate level, or a science and thus a legitimate research specialty of faculty and graduate students. We summarize the debate on this question that was conducted on GIS-L electronic listserver in late 1993. In evaluating this discussion it became clear that GIS could be understood not by the two distinct positions taken by the GIS-L discussants but as three positions along a continuum ranging from tool to science. These positions attach several meanings to "doing GIS." These are (1) GIS as tool, i.e., the use of a particular class of software, associated hardware tools, and digital geographic data in order to advance some specific purpose; (2) GIS as toolmaking, i.e., the advancement of the tool's capabilities and facilities (ease of use); and (3) the science of GIS, i.e., the analysis of the fundamental issues raised by the use of GIS. Recognizing the importance of understanding what is meant by "doing science" as well as what is meant by "doing GIS," we conclude that only one of these positions-"the science of GIS"-is a sufficient condition for science. The "toolmaker" position is rarely able to meet the test of science; and the "GIS is a tool" position involves "doing science" only if it yields progress on some substantive problem. The debate is certainly problematic in light of the variety of perspectives on science and on GIS. The persistence of the issue suggests, however, that the GIS community should continue to work toward a resolution.},

Responses will require a rethinking of ethical choices, the lack thereof and how this will guide scientists, governments, and corporate agencies in handling Big Data.
